 Xemark - Summer 2013

</li>
<ul>
<li>
 Xemark is a simple markdown language designed to be translated into html by a parser following it's BNF grammar. The parser was used as a component in generating this webpage. A bash script did the rest of the work. Xemark functions like a CGI 

</li>
script in that it's input is translated from one format to an output in another (in this case xemark markdown to html). Becuase of this property it is easy to use xemark within a http server context to serve .xe files up as html to users.
<li>
 You can see the repository for xemark <a href="https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/xemark">here </a> or see a site rendered by Xemark <a href="http://ejehardenberg.github.io/blog/how_this_site_was_made.html">here </a>
