    <h2>Your website is hideous!</h2>
<p>Is it? Is it? Probably. I&#39;m a bit of a minimalist and I simple clean 
look that these pages have.</p>
<h2>Some background on me: </h2>
<p>I grew up in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-u5WLJ9Yk4">90s</a>, learning how to program in Basic from a
programming book in 7th grade. I learned basic HTML in 8th grade and
throughout highschool I took classes in Flash, Visual Basic, C++ and web
design. Besides spending time on the computer, I played flute for 9 years
and picked up other instruments like guitar, drums, and the bass along 
the way. </p>
<p> I attended the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/">University of Vermont</a> and graduated in 2013 with a 
degree in <a href="http://www.molecularecologist.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/penguins-in-the-matrix-479271.jpg">Computer Science</a>. I was one class shy of an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_profilepage&gt;v=4niz8TfY794">applied math major</a> 
because I was busy leading two organizations (The <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cscrew/">CS Crew</a> and UVM&#39;s <a href="http://upe.acm.org/">UPE</a>
chapter), working for UVM&#39;s athletic marketing department, maintaining
<a href="http://www.vhfa.org/">VHFA</a>&#39;s seven websites, and doing contract work for <a href="http://www.brandthropology.com/">Brandthropology</a>.</p>
<p> My junior year I took a graduuate level evolutionary computation (EC)
 course  taught by <a href="http://www.cs.uvm.edu/~meppstei/">Maggie Eppstein</a> and coauthored a <a href="http://www.sigevo.org/gecco-2012/papers-accepted.html">paper published in GECCO</a>
 on the practical applications of such methods. By the end of my time at 
 University my focus was on EC methods and machine learning. My senior
 project was an application called Danger Zone. It aggregated tweets from
 twitter and used a Naive Bayes classifier to detect &#39;Dangerous&#39; locations
 by tweet geotags and content. Oh, and I also made a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwhGGChEUHg">Wiimote Whiteboard</a> 
with some friends as a fun project for the <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~cscrew/">CS Crew</a>!</p>
<h2>What I do now:</h2>
<p>After graduating I interned through a program called <a href="http://www.vthitec.org/">Vermont HITEC</a> and
landed an internship at <a href="http://www.bear-code.com/">Bear Code</a> working on Java 2EE and Rails
projects. I spent the summer working on the back end system for
<a href="http://www.youdiligence.com/">YouDilligence</a> and after a few months began designing
a system for a new client. Bear Code hired me after my internship was
over and now I work as a Junior Developer there. </p>
<p>In my spare time, I like to work on my personal projects as well as 
contribute to Open Source ones. You can check out my <a href="https://github.com/EJEHardenberg">Github</a> for a 
repository listing of my projects or to see what I&#39;m up to. Besides 
coding, I like to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3RStZO8X-Y">play piano</a>  (I improvise and have no formal training) 
and write music. I also redo my website on a semi-annual semi-regular 
basis. You can check out some of my previous versions <a href="http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~ejeldrid/contact.php">here</a>. </p>
<p>If you want to know more about me let me know through my contact form or
email me (my email is on my github). I have <a href="http://ethaneldridgecs.blogspot.com">another blog</a> besides the one
on this site if you&#39;re interested in that sort of thing. I try to keep
the two relatively in sync with each other but it&#39;s not guaranteed. I also
enjoy cooking and have made a <a href="http://ejehardenberg.github.io/cooking/">small site dedicated to my exploits</a>.</p>
