<h2>  Welcome!</h2>
You've stumbled on the personal webspace of the Programmer Ethan J. Eldridge. This space is where I run my own blog, host my tutorials and where you can find all the information needed to get in touch with me. </p><p>
I'm a graduate of the University of Vermont, where I breathed Computer Science and minored in math (one class shy of an applied math duel major). I spent most of my time managing the <a href=" http://www.uvm.edu/~cscrew/">CSCrew </a>and the Upsilon Pi Epsilon chapter of UVM. I took classes in Machine Learning, Evolutionary Computation, Evolutionary Robotics, and Data Mining. I'm an advocate of learning low level languages like Assembly and C as I believe it helps one become a better programmer when they have to think for themselves instead of letting a high level language do all the work for them (Not that I'm opposed to high level languages, but understanding and knowledge really sticks when you get into the details). I use git for my version control system of choice and highly recommend it to all programmers working in groups.</p><p>
I can go by many titles: Software Engineer, Full Stack Developer, Web Developer, Back-End developer, Code Monkey, Computer Scientist, etc, etc. However I prefer the title of Programmer or Problem Solver. Why? Because this describes what I do exactly. I enjoy taking on a challenge and solving any problems that arise during that undertaking. Typically, I solve the problems using programming. When I run into particularly difficult problems or just some eccentricity I tend to blog about it in hopes that it will help out the next person to deal with it.</p><p>
I'm an active member of the Open Source community and you can follow my work on <a href=" https://github.com/EJEHardenberg">github </a> or check out my other  <a href=" http://www.uvm.edu/~ejeldrid ">website </a> . If you'd like to contact me you can do so through the email account listed with my github. Or through the contact form available on my other <a href=" http://www.cems.uvm.edu/~ejeldrid/contact.php">website </a></p><p>
