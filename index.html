<h2>  <a href=" bacon">Welcome! </a></h2>
</p><p>
</p><p>
You've stumbled on the personal webspace of the Programmer Ethan J. Eldridge. This space is where I run my own blog, host my tutorials and where you can find all the information needed to get in touch with me. </p><p>
I can go by many titles: Software Engineer, Full Stack Developer, Web Developer, Back-End developer, Code Monkey, Computer Scientist, etc, etc. However I prefer the title of Programmer or Problem Solver. Why? Because this describes what I do exactly. I enjoy taking on a challenge and solving any problems that arise during that undertaking. Typically, I solve the problems using programming. When I run into particularly difficult problems or just some eccentricity I tend to blog about it in hopes that it will help out the next person to deal with it.</p><p>
I'm an active member of the Open Source community and you can follow my work on <a href=" https://github.com/EJEHardenberg">github </a> or check out my other  <a href=" http://www.uvm.edu/~ejeldrid ">website </a> . If you'd like to contact me you can do so through the email account listed with my github. Or through the contact form available on my other websites (Which is linked to a google spreadsheet if you're wondering). </p><p>
