Your website is hideous!
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Is it? Is it? Probably. I'm a bit of a minimalist to be honest. And I 
like shiny fancy things I like the simple clean look that these pages 
have.

Some background on me: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I grew up in the [90s]. Learned how to program in Basic from a
programming book in 7th grade. In 8th grade I learned basic html and
throughout highschool I took classes in Flash, Visual Basic, C++ and web
design. I played flute in the concert/marching band from 4th grade until
I graduated from Somersworth High School in 2009.

 I went to [college] and graduated in 2013 with a degree in 
[Computer Science]. I was one class shy of an [applied math major] and
I led two orginizations: The [CS Crew] and UVM's [UPE] chapter. While I
was doing that I also had a work study job with UVM's atheletic
marketing departent as well as TWO internships. One maintaining [VHFA]
websites for the state and the other doing contract work for
[Brandthropology]. Someone how I managed to do all of that and get a
[paper published in GECCO] my junior year. Focusing on evolutionary
computation methods and machine learning I eventually ended up working
on a senior project called Danger Zone that aggregated tweets from
twitter and used a Naive Bayes classifier to try to detect 'Dangerous'
locations by tweet geotagging. Oh, and I also made a [Wiimote Whiteboard] 
with some friends as a fun project for the [CS Crew].

What I do now mostly:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After graduating I interned through a program called [Vermont HITEC] and
landed an internship at [Bear Code] working on Java 2EE and Rails
projects. I spent the summer working on the back end system for
something called [YouDilligence] and after a few months began designing
a system for a new client. Bear Code hired me after my internship was
over and now I work as a Junior Developer there. 

In my spare time (Which there isn't much of because of a commute that
makes me have a 12 hour or so average work day) I like to work on my
personal projects as well as contribute to Open Source ones. You can
check out my [github] for a repository listing of my projects or to see
what I'm up to. Besides coding, I like to [play piano] (I improvise and
have no formal training) and write music. I also redo my website on a
semi-annual semi-regular basis. You can check out some of my previous
versions [here] [and here]. 

If you want to know more about me let me know through my contact form or
email me (my email is on my github). I have [another blog] besides the one
on this site if you're interested in that sort of thing. I try to keep
the two relatively in sync with each other but it's not always a
guaranteed thing.
