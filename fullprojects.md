-----------------------------------------------------------------------


- TimeCatcher - Fall 2013
	- TimeCatcher is a time logging utility which doesn't eat your CPU cycles. Most logging software runs in the background spinning the clock away to keep track of your progress. TimeCatcher works on a simple start and stop system managed through the command line in order to not do that. Memory leak free and supporting command completion through bash shells, time catcher is a simple to use and good time logging program.
	- You can checkout the [TimeCatcher Repository here]:https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/timecatcher

- Xemark - Summer 2013
	- Xemark is a simple markdown language designed to be translated into html by a parser following it's BNF grammar. The parser was used as a component in generating this webpage. A bash script made did the rest of the work. Xemark functions like a CGI script in that it's input is translated from one format to an output in another (in this case xemark markdown to html). Becuase of this property it is easy to use xemark within a http server context to serve .xe files up as html to users.
	- You can see the repository for [xemark here]
	
- Green Up VT - Summer 2013
	- An application to assist with [GreenUp Vermont] and help to coordinate volunteers. Developed as part of the national [Civic day of hacking] challenge by [Code for BTV]. The application was hastily made in php during the event. Then heaviy refactored into a RESTful API with mobile,ios and android client interfaces (Still in progress). My main contribution was the specification, design, and implementation of the REST api backend done in python. Also primarily responsible for task delegation and repository contribution maintenance.
	- You can see our current progress on the [Green Up project here]
	
- Linkregater - Summer 2013
	- A web crawling visualization written in Javascript and making use of HTML5's canvas for drawing. Simply enter a url and watch it do it's work! It does perform a large number of HTTP requests and might slow down your browser while it runs. Simply close the tab if it becomes a problem. 
	- Check out [the Linkregater App here]
	
- Rat-a-tat-cat - Spring 2013

- Craigs Crawler -Spring 2013
	- A web crawler that uses a Naive Bayes classifer to figure out what price range an apartment listing is in by its title text and description. Written in Ruby, the project uses the [Naive Bayes implementation by alexandru]. Created to do my final paper for CS 332 Data Mining with [Xindong Wu]
	- [Read the paper] or [Check out the repository]
	
- Go Fish For Software Engineering (CS 205) -Spring 2013
	- A console version of Go Fish, created collaboratively with Joshua Dickerson, Scott MacEwan, Danielle Steimke, and Phelan Vendeville. Recieved a more than Perfect Score from the grader, with bonus points. 
	- See the [go fish github repository here]
	
- BrainFuck Interpreter written in C -Spring 2013
	- The esoteric language of BrainFuck is one of those languages that's fun to create an interpreter for. Here is my version, written in pure C. 
	- See the [BF github repository here]
	
- Danger Zone -Fall 2012
	-  A class-wide software engineering project for CS 276 at UVM. Using twitter data to find regions of high danger in the world and display them to users so that they can avoid them. My role was on the Server/Machine Learning team, creating a classifier for tweets. As well as constructing a command interface between php and java to link the Zend Server pages to the Java Classifier. 
	- My work on the [danger zone project]
	- The [danger zone projects website]  (As new iterations of the class occur, this website may go down)
	
- WayPoint -Fall 2012
	- An android application designed for runners. Users set down markers on a map and then when they reach it, it takes down the time. When the final marker is reached, the total times are displayed. 
	- See the [Waypoint github repository here]
	
- Green Bean -Fall 2012
	- A team app created for the Hack VT competition in Winooski, VT. The app listed ingredients using a recipe API and then our app displayed farms where those ingredients could be found. Weather data for the last year was integrated into the colouring of the markers of the farm to show how much precipitation had fallen, to render a crude quality estimate of the crops. Once ingredients were selected, a user could select dishes to get recipes using the ingredients they had selected
	- [See the news article about the project here]
	
- SKU Maker -Summer 2012
	- A small program I made to assist with automating my internship with Big Movie Database.com. Simple form entry generates XML that associates products on Buy.com to youtube trailers. 
	- [See the blog posts on SKU Maker]
	
- Krupa, J.S., Chatterjee, S., Eldridge, E., Rizzo, D.M., and Eppstein, M.J. “Evolutionary Feature Selection for Classification: A Plug-In Hybrid Vehicle Adoption Application”, accepted for Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference (GECCO), 2012. -Fall 2011/Spring 2012
	- real world application of Genetic Algorithms in analysis of a large consumer survey relayed to Plug in Hybrid Electric Vehicles.
