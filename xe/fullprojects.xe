## Full list of projects I've worked on in the past

<:projects:
- Xemark - Summer 2013
	<
		- Xemark is a simple markdown language designed to be translated into html by a parser following it's BNF grammar. The parser was used as a component in generating this webpage. A bash script made did the rest of the work. Xemark functions like a CGI 
		script in that it's input is translated from one format to an output in another (in this case xemark markdown to html). Becuase of this property it is easy to use xemark within a http server context to serve .xe files up as html to users.
		- You can see the repository for xemark here -> https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/xemark or see a site rendered by Xemark here ->  http://ejehardenberg.github.io/blog/how_this_site_was_made.html

- Green Up VT - Summer 2013
	<
		- An application to assist with GreenUpVermont -> http://www.greenupvermont.org/ and help to coordinate volunteers. Developed as part of the national civic day of hacking -> hackforchange.org challenge by code for btv -> codeforbtv.org , The application was hastily made in php during the event. Then heaviy refactored into a RESTful API with mobile,ios and android client interfaces (Still in progress). My main contribution was the specification, design, and implementation of the REST api backend done in python. Also primarily responsible for task delegation and repository contribution maintenance.
		- You can see our current progress on the project here -> https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/GreenUp

- Kirby Cross - Summer 2013
	<
		- A simple game made in HTML and Javascript, exactly like frogger, but with a little pink blob instead of a frog. The entire game is made in HTML5 and pure javascript. I also made a tutorial -> http://www.uvm.edu/~ejeldrid/tutorial/frogger/index.html explaining the steps in making a frogger game just like it.
		- You can play the game here -> http://www.uvm.edu/~ejeldrid/projects/KirbyCross/

- Linkregater - Summer 2013
	<
		- A web crawling visualization written in Javascript and making use of HTML5's canvas for drawing. Simply enter a url and watch it do it's work! It does perform a large number of HTTP requests and might slow down your browser while it runs. Simply close the tab if it becomes a problem. 
		- Check out the App here -> http://www.uvm.edu/~ejeldrid/projects/linkregater/ 
	>
- Rat-a-tat-cat - Spring 2013

- Danger Zone -Fall 2012
	<
		-  A class-wide software engineering project for CS 276 at UVM. Using twitter data to find regions of high danger in the world and display them to users so that they can avoid them. My role was on the Server/Machine Learning team, creating a classifier for tweets. As well as constructing a command interface between php and java to link the Zend Server pages to the Java Classifier.

- WayPoint -Fall 2012
	< 
		- An android application designed for runners. Users set down markers on a map and then when they reach it, it takes down the time. When the final marker is reached, the total times are displayed. 
		- See the github repository here -> https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/WayPoint
	>
- Green Bean -Fall 2012
	<
		- A team app created for the Hack VT competition in Winooski, VT. The app listed ingredients using a recipe API and then our app displayed farms where those ingredients could be found. Weather data for the last year was integrated into the colouring of the markers of the farm to show how much precipitation had fallen, to render a crude quality estimate of the crops. Once ingredients were selected, a user could select dishes to get recipes using the ingredients they had selected

- Cluster - Spring-Summer 2011
	< 
		- A 3-Phase project that involved simulated swarm agents that bred until collectively they were able to push a block through a maze in C++. The Cluster sometimes fails, but only due to it's greedy approach to obstacle avoidance. The paper discusses runtime analysis as well as features and design choices within the project itself.
