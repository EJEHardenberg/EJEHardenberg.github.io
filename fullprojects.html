 Green Up VT - Summer 203

</li>
<ul>
<li>
 An application to assist with <a href="http://www.greenupvermont.org/">GreenUpVermont </a> and help to coordinate volunteers. Developed as part of the national civic day of <a href="hackforchange.org">hacking </a> challenge by code for <a href="codeforbtv.org">btv </a> , The application was hastily made in php during the event. Then heaviy refactored into a RESTful API with mobile,ios and android client interfaces (Still in progress). My main contribution was the specification, design, and implementation of the REST api backend done in python. Also primarily responsible for task delegation and repository contribution maintenance.

<li>
  A class-wide software engineering project for CS 276 at UVM. Using twitter data to find regions of high danger in the world and display them to users so that they can avoid them. My role was on the Server/Machine Learning team, creating a classifier for tweets. As well as constructing a command interface between php and java to link the Zend Server pages to the Java Classifier.

 WayPoint -Fall 2012

 Green Bean -Fall 2012

</li>
<ul>
<li>
 A team app created for the Hack VT competition in Winooski, VT. The app listed ingredients using a recipe API and then our app displayed farms where those ingredients could be found. Weather data for the last year was integrated into the colouring of the markers of the farm to show how much precipitation had fallen, to render a crude quality estimate of the crops. Once ingredients were selected, a user could select dishes to get recipes using the ingredients they had selected
