      <h2>Trivial</h2>
      
      <div>
      	<p>They had won! The team of five celebrated with a hearty cheer amidst the
noisy bar. Tables, chairs, and leftover beer marked the victory of the
several teams now pumping their fists in victory. It had been a simple
challenge, answer the trivia questions, and the party had done well
enough to come in second place.</p>
<p>As a victor, they each had claimed a small prize from the table by the
hosts. Hats, cups, bandanas, and t-shirts were available and each person
had taken one. The troupe cheerfully funneled out from the bar to the
street with their loot. Short and pleasant goodbyes exchanged, hugs
between good friends, firm handshakes amongst the newly-mets. The night
might be young, but many departing members were not. Their heads filled
with warm thoughts of their beds.</p>
<p>A younger man departed from the group waving his won t-shirt goodbye.
His steps echoing off the concrete sidewalk as he hurried home. A
bearded and ragged looking man peered up at him from his stoop on the
corner as he passed.</p>
<p>&quot;Any spare change brother?&quot;</p>
<p>The usual response ushered itself from the rushing man, his steps briefly
slowing from the pace he had set to pass the homeless quickly. <em>No
change, didn&#39;t carry cash</em>. A truthful and dispassionate line. As the
distance between the two increased, the victor glanced at the plush
weight in his hand.</p>
<p>He stopped.</p>
<p>The tag read XL, a size the slender man would only wear as a pajama. A
large brand name for a local beer splashed across the chest area, yet
another reason the man would probably not wear it in public. His trophy
of the night, a small bundle, meant little to him. He glanced over his
shoulder. Tattered pant bottoms grazed the dirty ground; their faded
blue a testament of wear, tear, and years of poverty. The shirt the
homeless man jammed his fingers into, huddling over for warmth, was thin
as well. Eyes full of longing for a friendly glance, a small token of
care, he didn&#39;t pause to reach out with his voice to each passerby. Every denial
an understanding nod, every grace a shameful but grateful nod and
heartfelt thanks.</p>
<p>Turning on his heel, the team member walked back and gave the shirt
away.</p>
