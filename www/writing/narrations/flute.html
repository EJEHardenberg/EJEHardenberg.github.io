   <h2>
    The Flute's Memory
   </h2>
   <div>
    <p>
     The tears stacked in his eyes like the concrete of a dam. Stifled and unyielding,
the waters were kept at bay by sheer force of will. The mind reeling, jumping 
from thought to thought without time for a reply. Each word and thought was 
accompanied by a dozen more bubbling to the surface.
    </p>
    <p>
     The thoughts drifted. Away from immediate issues. Away from the causes of this
predicament. The red rimmed eyes fixated on a point on the dresser opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
     The flute.
    </p>
    <p>
     Pulling back the haze in his mind, a single memory hurled forth to replay against 
the internal darkness of his eyelids. Music. It had always given him comfort back
then. Whenever loneliness, bullys, or sadness found him he retreated to the dark
circles on the page. The calligraphy font of a musical direction to follow a phrase
or to repeat back to a Coda.
    </p>
    <p>
     But it had failed him before.
    </p>
    <p>
     The feelings tremored underneath his eyes. Cross-legged on the matress, clutching 
the silver instrument. The tears poured from underneath the childs eyes.
Shaking, the boy raised the flute to his lips. Breathy and aired, a note sounded
loosely through the sniffles. Shaking his head and sitting up straighter, he
repositioned his back to be ram-rod straight. Then, leveling the flute with the
ground he played.
    </p>
    <p>
     Eyes closed, the muscle memory served him well. The strains of a concert piece
began to take place around him. However, the brows were furrowed. The stance rigid
and the music was not having the relaxing effect it should have. A few more measures
and the air wouldn't come to play the notes anymore.
    </p>
    <p>
     Tears reappeared and shined the eyes into sorrow. The streaks of tears
making small rivers down the cheeks dribbled down the chin and when the boy paused
to wipe them away, the flute came down, the shoulders slumped and the hand never 
made it to the chin. Tightly clenched, the child's hands flipped through the sheet
paper, looking for anything that would stop the feelings.
