      <h2>Together Again</h2>
      <div>
        <p>The strains of a guitar rung out over the empty streets in a small
suburban neighborhood. The man sat on the railing of a second story
porch strumming the old instrument. One leg under his body, the other
stretched out to the wooden support holding the roof up. Body leaned 
against his white washed apartment wall, his eyes kept watch on
the sidewalk at the end of the driveway. </p>
<p>He was waiting for her. They had kept in contact since their last
encounter, and finally, another opportunity had presented itself. A time
for them to be together, uninterupted and alone. His guitars tones were
light, rythms upbeat and happy. He was excited. </p>
<p>Zoned out, he started a bit when he glanced back to his driveway and saw
her standing at the end of it, looking up at him. His hands kept playing
absent mindedly as he took her in: </p>
<p>Brown hair, pulled back against the wind in a loose bun on top of her
head, a few stranges had jumped out and thrown themselves across her
face. Her small lips were curled into a half smile, coy and playful as
she her dark eyes peered lovingly up at her man. Her smallness
exagerated by his vantage point, he smiled back at her and let out a
loud chord of welcome. Her half smile burst into a full one and she
hop-skipped to his stairs, her chest bouncing a little bit under her
sweater. As her footfalls on the wooden steps became louder, he swung his legs
off the railing and placed his guitar against the porch&#39;s low wall.</p>
<p>He looked up in time to see her rushing forward towards him. If she
hadn&#39;t grabbed him into a fast hug he would have tumbled off. Her face
was buried into his chest and he could feel the heat of her body
radiating against his. His arms fell easily around her, and as he
slipped off the railing and stood against her, he cupped her chin in his
hand and lifted her face towards his. </p>
<p>Lips met and parted, her tongue reached out for his, and his embrace
tightened. Bringing her closer to him, they kissed until they were
forced to seperate to gasp for air. Panting, each looked into the
other&#39;s eyes. Smiling, they greeted one another for the first time in
months. Face to face, eye to eye, and body to body. Continuing to kiss,
they pushed against the door. His hand fumbling behind him to turn the 
door&#39;s knob. Her hand roaming to grasp at his. </p>
<p>The door pushed open, and he took a step back into his house, hand
holding hers and their lips locked. Smiling as they kissed and moved
forward through the rooms. He pushed her against the wall and pressed
his body against hers, his tongue caressing hers within her mouth and
one hand running through her hand as his other pulled offer his shoes.</p>
<p>Following his lead she wrapped her legs around him and lifted herself up
onto his. His hands gripping her bottom as hers wrapped around his neck.
She kicked off her shoes and began nibbling his ear. Her tongue sliding
over the outer curve before her teeth gently came down on his lobe. </p>
<p>Containing his shivers, he hoisted her body against his and walked into
his bedroom. Pulling away from her for a moment, he smiled at her. Her
puzzled expression quickly shifted to delighted surprise as he tossed her
down onto the bed. Rising up, legs spread, she grabbed his shirt and
tugged him down on top of her. Her hands slipped under his shirt.
Feeling the warm planes on his chest, the muscles underneath flexed from
holding his weight above her. She began kissing his neck as his hips
started grinding against her. </p>
<p>Pulling up on his shirt, she happily squirmed under. Licking
his nipple and scratching at his back. Laughing, he pulled his shirt
over his head and threw it at her and dived between her legs. Pushing
his head against her thighs and mouthing random shapes between her legs.
A small moan escaped her lips, she paused to enjoy the feelings for a
moment before she pulled him up to kiss again. </p>
<p>Her lips locked with his. Pulling  her shirt off she pressed her
body to his. Feeling her pert nipples and soft breasts squishing against
him, his hands found their way around them. Cupping each one as he
brought his mouth over her neck, kissing down her collarbones, and onto the
nipple as he began kneading the other breast. </p>
<p>Hearing her vindicative moans, he pulled her farther up onto the bed to
continue pleasuring her. Her hand pushed down between them and grabbed
at the rising manhood that had begun pressing against her. His kisses
swept back up her body and onto her ear. His tongue sliding down into
her ear, she squeeled a little before happily turning the tables and
rolling on top of him. Pressing her own mouth against his. Tongue
wrapping around its partner. </p>
<p>They grinded and dry humped, kissing each other over and over, gasping
for air between and smiling the whole time. Their bodies pressed against
each other, topless and warm, their hands moving, scratching, and
clutching at each others as if they would find god if they searched hard
enough. </p>
<p>Bringing her legs up, she poised her feet at his hips and began trying
to push his pants down. Getting the hint, he straightened up, eyes
locked with hers as they both removed the final pieces of their
outerwear. As he brought himself back against her, his penis slipped out
between the folds in his boxer and pressed against the wet cotton of her
panties. She dug her nails into his back as he teased her clit through
the fabric. Moaning as his lips closed over her neck, sucking hard, and
when he pulled away a bright bold hicky lay across her skin. She gasped,
asking with her eyes if he had just given her what she thought he had.
His response was to murmor into her ear to mark him as hers. </p>
<p>She ran her fingers through his hair, halfway through gripping tightly
and pulling his head sideways, exposing his neck to her. Letting go of
his hair, she wrapped an arm around him and began sucking. Her tongue
danced across his neck a few times, sending shivers down his spine,
small moans escaping him. His hands pawed at her back as she bit down
slightly. </p>
<p>She pulled away, and surveyed her handiwork. He looked down at her and
smiled. His hand cupped her cheek and pulled her up to him. His tongue
diving into her mouth and swirling. Kissing her from the left, then
right, then left again until he had to pull away for air. He was on top
of her again, grinding against her. Her panties getting wetter and
clinging to his member as it slid against her. </p>
<p>Unwrapping her legs from him, she gave him a quick peck on the cheek,
winked, and then slid down. He looked down in time to see her arch her
neck up and then he felt her tongue glide against the vein of his
erection. Her mouth was warm and wet and he hardly dare to move at first
as he felt her work her lips up and down his shaft. He looked down at
her and caught her looking up at him, he thrusted his hips slightly,
looking at her for approval. She winked, and he began moving his hips
slightly, slowly moving in and out of her mouth.</p>
<p>Soft moans involunteerily breathed out of him, he felt her slip out to
inhale and quickly spun around, bringing his face between her legs and
buried himself into her scent. He flicked his tongue underneath her
panties and lined her lips with the tip of his tongue. Massaging her
clit with his thumb, he felt her resume her own activities between his
legs. stroking his shaft while her mouth and tongue toyed the head. One
of her hands began gently rubbing his balls, and he pulled her underwear
away to begin mouthing words against into her, parting her lips as he
mouthed an &quot;O&quot; and letting his tongue dip into her before licking the
height of her opening and begining to trace figure eights around her clit. 
His fingers began working her, hooking into her and rubbing her walls.
She shivered and groaned, her legs coming together around his head and
then back down as he moved in and out. </p>
<p>Switching to just stroking the dangling pole above her head, she moaned
and let herself dissolve into feeling his tongue and fingers inside and
against her. Her fingers clawed into the bed, gripping tightly as she
let out a squeel of pleasure. He quickly spun his fingers inside of her
and  she wrapped her arms around his body, his name exploding from her
lips. He stopped a moment and looked back at her, teasingly asking if
she had liked that. When she was about to respond he did it again, her
back arching as another moan came from within her. She smiled, and
slapped his ass. Jerking on his penis quickly she felt him pause to
enjoy the feeling. Two simple words escaped from her that halted him
again. </p>
<p>Fuck. Me. </p>
<p>He slipped off of her, resting on his side next to her, he pulled her
against him as if he was going to spoon her. Then rolled on top of her,
pinning her underneath him. He began undalating his body against her.
Using his chest and stomach as one giant hand to massage her back. His
fingers tangled themselves with hers and he stretched his arms. Bringing
hers in front of her and his face down to her ear. His tongue tracing the
outside of her ear, he asked her what she had said. </p>
<p>He felt her arch her back, bringing her toned cheeks around his hard
manhood. She flexed, then rolled her hips. Gripping him and rubbing him.
His hands slipped away from hers and wrapped around her waist. Grinding
against her, he heard himself moan and nuzzled his face into her hair.
Inhaling her scent. She continued rubbing him between her cheeks, but
reached out to the nightstand and felt for a condom. She pulled one leg
underneath her, positioning him for an easy thrust inside. </p>
<p>Glancing over her shoulder at him, lashes lowered, she held out the
condom. He took it and slipped it on, but repositioned into missionary,
his head slid between her lips but rested at the entrance. She wrapped
her legs around him, and one of his arms slid underneath her, pulling
her body close to his. He placed on hand on her cheek and kissed her
slowly. His mouth covering hers, then only each corner, then his tongue
gliding down against hers. Theirs eyes locked, he felt her hand place
itself on top of his shoulder, then the other onto the back of his head. </p>
<p>They paused for a moment, taking in the feeling. Quiet. It was just the
two of them in the whole world. Anticipating each other, having waited
so long for this, it was something to savor. </p>
<p>She squeezed down on him with her legs, and he thrust into her, sliding
in fully down to the base. She gasped as he filled her, and then let out
a satisfied moan that mixed with his as he pulled halfway out and back
in again. Finding a rythm they began kissing again as they pushed and
pulled against each other. Gasping for air between moans and rubbing
skin against skin, they embraced each other. Arms slipping out from
underneath her, he cupped his hands around her bottom, firmly gripping
and squeezing as he used it for leverage as he started moving faster.</p>
<p>Their panting increasing, a sequence of yes&#39;s began eminating from her
lips, huskily whispering his name into his ear, punctuated between gasps
and moans of pleasure.  Her lips came together, letting out a long drawn
out noise of satisfaction. She brought his face down to hers, kissing
him roughly before she  spasmed and cluthed at his back, moaning, &quot;not
yet. Not yet, I want more&quot;. </p>
<p>He kissed her and brought into a tight hug, then rolled his body,
bringing her into the top position. He relaxed, letting her take over
the speed and rythm. Watching the bounce of her breasts as she brought
herself down onto him over and over, he began to thrust upward as she came
down. Each time she screamed loudly in ecstatic pleasure. Reaching out, he
squeezed her chest and then, straightening his body out, he brought his
mouth to her nipple. Flicking a tongue over the hard tip and then
sucking. </p>
<p>Her arms wrapped and holding him tightly to her body, she brought
herself up and then fell down onto him, again and again, feeling him
fill her. The heat of their bodies mixing, and their moans. She
felt his hands fall away from her breasts and down to her hips again,
bracing himself against her as she slammed down onto him over and over.
Coming away from him until the tip of his manhood was nearly outside of
her, then letting gravity pull her down, splitting her apart and sending
sensations throughout her entire body. Satisfying her urges briefly, but
then with renewed hunger she felt she needed more. And she screamed it,
wanting more, getting louder and louder with each and every penetrating
thrust. </p>
<p>She panted, and dropped herself around him, twisting to the side to
bring him on top of her again. Wanting his speed, his rythm, his filling
her with every pleasuring thrust, pentrating and brushing away every moment 
besides this one, in this moment there was only this sensation. The feeling 
of him. Her lover.</p>
<p>For him as well, his time was running out. The gorgeous women beneath
him, quivering and moaning at his every touch and thrust had brought him
closer and closer to orgasm. He could feel it building deep within. His
penis becoming more and more sensitive with each thrust; his everything
thought was filling with her. Forgetting anything and everything that
wasn&#39;t part of this moment with her was inconsequential. </p>
<p>Together they teased, twisted, and rose higher and higher on each other.
Better than any drug they could possibly do, she clutched on him, wrapping
her legs and arms oround him and holding her inside of her as she
spasmed and her body shivered and she felt her orgasm rush over her.
Waves of pleasure ebbing and flowing with each rise and fall of her
hips. The heat spreading from between her legs and into them, up her
stomach and through her spine. She screamed his name as he yelled hers.
Their voices filling the room and their love making done. </p>
<p>For now.</p>
