			<h1>The Proposed Drone Privacy Law</h1>
		</header>

		<div id="content">
			<h2><a href="disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></h2>
			<h3>Drone Aircraft Privacy and Transparency Act</h3><p>Today I recieved the newsletter of <a href="http://www.welch.house.gov/">Representative Peter Welch</a>. He 
listed a few items, but the one that caught my eye was his headline: 
<em>&quot;Protecting your right to privacy from domestic drones&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>As matters of privacy <a href="sec-309">interest me</a>, I looked at <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s635/text">the bill text</a> and 
discussed it with a few friends. The bill can be summarized rather 
<a href="http://welch.house.gov/press-releases/sen-markey-rep-welch-introduce-legislation-to-ensure-transparency-privacy-for-drone-use1/">simply</a>, or if you prefer the official summary you can read congress&#39;s 
<a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s635/summary">here</a>. In essence, besides the exceptions of <em>&quot;imminent danger&quot;</em> or 
<em>&quot;a high risk of an imminent terrorist attack by a specific individual 
or organization, according to the Secretary of Homeland Security&quot;</em>,
the government would be required to release Data collection statements 
as well as attempt to minimization the amount of data they collect that 
isn&#39;t pertinent to the task at hand.</p>
<p>In simplest terms, transparency of drone surveillance by the US 
government for its citizens. In pessimistic terms, a piece of 
legislation that will not make it into law. According to the <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s635">govtrack website</a> 
the bill has a 1% chance of being enacted. The <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/about/analysis#prognosis">analysis</a> is based on 
historical data of other bills, and the key points that make this bill 
unlikely to pass are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The sponsor is a member of the minority party (senate).</li>
<li>This bill was a re-introduction of S. 1639 (113th) from the previous session of Congress.</li>
<li>Which itself was a re-introduction of the bill of the same title for 2012</li>
<li>The bill was referred to House Energy and Commerce.</li>
</ul>
<p>In my mind there&#39;s a much larger reason why the bill has such a low chance 
to pass. The government enjoys having an unprecedented amount of ability 
in surveillance tactics and doesn&#39;t want to give it up. After all, this type 
of thing can be used <a href="http://textually.org/drones/cat_surveillance_dr.html">for good</a>. However, they&#39;re not always <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-surveillance-drones-largely-ineffective-along-border-report-says/2015/01/06/5243abea-95bc-11e4-aabd-d0b93ff613d5_story.html">effective</a></p>
<blockquote>
    &quot;In an audit of the fleet’s operations during fiscal 2013, the inspector general calculated that it cost $12,255 per flight hour to operate the drones, five times as much as Customs and Border Protection had estimated.
    <br>
    ...
    <br>
    As evidence, the report cited statistics showing that of the 120,939 illegal border crossers apprehended in Arizona during 2013, fewer than 2 percent were caught with the help of drones providing aerial surveillance.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>As is common, privacy law lags behind (some might say a lag of about 13 years and 5 month*) 
new methods of intelligence. Right now, there are no explicit privacy protections 
or public transparency measures with respect to UAV in written law. So this bill 
would be a milestone. This bill compliments the protection of privacy and the general 
rights of the 4th amendment quite well:</p>
<blockquote>
    &quot;A governmental entity (as defined in section 2711 of title 18, United States Code) may not use an unmanned aircraft system or request information or data collected by another person using an unmanned aircraft system for protective activities, or for law enforcement or intelligence purposes, except pursuant to a warrant&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>In addition, <strong>section 4d &amp; 4e</strong> allows a citizen to sue upon violations of the 
bill and their privacy rights. This means that if the bill passed, if you had 
evidence of being spied upon by government drones unlawfully, you could sue the 
government and win.</p>
<p>Hobbyists of drones might be a little alarmed at the thought of needing a license 
and reporting any data collection they might do. However, this version of the bill 
(unlike 2013&#39;s) includes the <strong>Model aircraft provision</strong> in Section 5.</p>
<blockquote>
    &quot;Nothing in this Act may be construed to apply to model aircraft (as defined in section 336(c) of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012 (Public Law 112–95; 49 U.S.C. 40101 note)).&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if you&#39;re a hobbyist and just flying your <a href="https://www.modelaircraft.org/files/HR658_020112.pdf">little drone</a> around to 
take a few pictures for fun. You&#39;re ok. If you&#39;re selling video or images taken 
by your drone, <a href="http://amablog.modelaircraft.org/amagov/2012/10/21/can-i-use-my-model-aircraft-to-do-aerial-photography/">you might want to read this</a>. For an official source, check the 
<a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/model_aircraft/">faa</a>. The legislature&#39;s need for license to fly your drone for commercial use 
<a href="https://www.faa.gov/uas/media/Sec_331_336_UAS.pdf">isn&#39;t new</a>, and only the transparency and data minimization/collection pieces 
of the bill offer annoyances to hobbyists.</p>
<p>If you ask me though, a little annoyance to a few hobbyists who are looking to 
monetize their drone data is worth the trouble if it helps to keep citizen&#39;s 
private lives private; not to mention what a victory for this bill would 
represent to all of the disgruntled citizens who have grown disenfranchised 
with their own government.</p>
<p>* Today is March 26th, do the math.</p>
