    As always,
    <a href="http://www.ethanjoachimeldridge.info/writing/political/disclaimer">
     the disclaimer

    applies to this whole post. But in addition 
I just want to state that I am not an economist or anything of that 
sort. I simply am curious.
   </p>
   <h3>
    The data
   </h3>
   <p>
    A New York Times article recently listed the
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html?_r=0">
     costs of mobile ads
    </a>
    for 
the top 50 online news entities. The Times did their own analysis, averaging
load times with and without ad blockers 10 times for each website over the 
course of 2 days. While this doesn't strike me as particularly rigorous, 
they did find some interesting points:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The difference was easy to spot: many websites loaded faster and felt easier to use. Data is also expensive. We estimated that on an average American cell data plan, each megabyte downloaded over a cell network costs about a penny. Visiting the home page of Boston.com every day for a month would cost the equivalent of about $9.50 in data usage just for the ads.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    and
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     more than half of all data came from ads
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    That's right. In general, most of the content you're loading on a phone 
is actually just advertisements trying to get you to buy something. I 
suppose it's not that suprising, after all, ads fund the internet.
   </p>
   <h3>
    The question
   </h3>
   <p>
    But as I read the article and looked at the results. I wondered if the 
companies that had less ads and more content had more loyal userbases, 
or if it had no effect at all. While one can't measure loyalty, one can 
measure revenue. And specifically, I wonder if less ads on a page would
result in more revenue for the company since users would be more likely 
to not use an ad blocker if the ads aren't in their way constantly.
   </p>
   <p>
    So, the question formulated in my head was simple:
    <em>
     Is less more?
    </em>
   </p>
   <h3>
    A quick case study
   </h3>
   <p>
    While looking for relevant statistics, I looked at
    <a href="http://www.journalism.org/media-indicators/digital-top-50-online-news-entities-2015/">
     the source
    </a>
    of the 
Time's list of news companies and after some browsing found out that 
Yahoo, which was the second lowest in ad content and load times, was also 
one of the
    <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2015/04/29/digital-news-revenue-fact-sheet/">
     top 5 companies generating revenue from ads
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Five companies – Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Yahoo and AOL – still generated 61% of total domestic digital ad revenue in 2014
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Yahoo generated
    <a href="http://www.journalism.org/media-indicators/top-five-companies-in-digital-advertising/">
     2.55
     <em>
      billion
     </em>
     dollars in 2014
    </a>
    , even though the ratio of 
ad to editorial content according to the New York Times was 0.2:2.4. The 
amount of time spent to load the advertisements was one of the lowest as 
well, 0.4 seconds of ad load time to 4.7 of loading real content. While 
they may not beat out google or facebook, according to the Pew Research 
Center they are
    <a href="http://www.journalism.org/media-indicators/digital-top-50-online-news-entities-2015/">
     number one in terms of visitation and engagement
    </a>
    .
   </p>
   <p>
    Clearly. They're doing something right.
   </p>
   <h3>
    But does it generalize?
   </h3>
   <p>
    But one company is not a large enough sample size to get a feeling around 
whether more ads are better or not. So instead, we should look at the 
other 49 companies listed. There's two types of revenue for most companies:
Operating revenue and non-operating revenue. Operating revenue is earned 
by whatever the company sells as their main product or service. Non-operating 
revenue is from investments. I'm interested in the total revenue of each 
company, and if available, what the total revenue from the advertisements 
is.
   </p>
   <p>
    Unfortunately, for many companies in the top 50 I couldn't find the information
or reports. I've listed the reasons why below:

     <strong>
      Boston.com:

     Boston.com is part of The New England Media Group, which
     <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/business/media/judge-lifts-injunction-and-times-completes-sale-of-boston-globe.html">
      was sold
     </a>
     to John W. Henry in 2013, which, along with its other outlets 
in the group, was
