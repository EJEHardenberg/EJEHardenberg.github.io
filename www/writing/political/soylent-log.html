<h3>Wait What?</h3><p>Soylent is the brain child of <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/">this guy</a> who made some splashes when he 
decided to <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298">&quot;stop eating food&quot;</a>. It&#39;s designed to be a meal replacement 
for one, two, or all of your meals as you like it. With the original 
intent of saving time for the busy, and making a healthy alternative to 
other inexpensive food, it&#39;s pretty neat. I was intrigued when I read 
the original blog posts and then decided to try it myself after reading 
<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2013/08/20/soylent/">this blog post about it</a>. I figure&#39;d that I&#39;d keep a sort of log about 
it to offer my opinion to anyone else who finds this page. I&#39;m not going 
to focus on the quality of writing, and this is more of a stream of 
consciousness than anything else:</p>
<h3>Day 1:</h3><p>Initial thoughts:</p>
<p>Reading all those blogs and anecdotes about it, specifically the fourhourworkweek
post prepared me pretty well. I was lucky enough to get an emersion blender
for free this week and so my drink is pretty smooth. I got the powder
version of v1.5. The smell reminds me like flour. And the taste is like
soy, but creamy like milk at the same time. I can feel a little grit
texture wise, but oddly enough it doesn&#39;t linger in my mouth with any
bad after taste. It goes down smoothly and my initial thought, like many
others I think, is: &quot;Huh, better than expected&quot;.</p>
<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="/images/soylent/2016-06-25.jpg" title="My first up of Soylent">
</div>

<h3>Day 2:</h3><p>Only had a little bit this morning because I had to travel out of state
and didn&#39;t want to lug a large pitcher with me. But the taste was still
fine, still drinking the batch I made on Day 1.</p>
<h3>Day 3:</h3><p>Had another cup of soylent for dinner, had to work late (on a weekend)
and so I didn&#39;t actually have Soylent for lunch like I had originally
planned. I did bring a small bottle of it with me to work, but it seems 
that after a couple days keeping the drink from clumping becomes more 
difficult, and the clumps were really off putting to me. Later, at night, 
I put the remaining Soylent from lunch into my blender and it made it 
drinkable again. While at work I experimented with holding chocolate to 
my nose before drinking, it was interesting how much that changed the 
perception of the taste of soylent. Tomorrow I&#39;ll try putting strawberries 
into it. I also used my blender rather than an emersion blender and had 
better results with removing clumps. The soylent instructions say that 
2 days is typically the max for a batch before it goes rancid so I&#39;ll 
have to make a new one tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Day 4:</h3><p>I woke up much later than I should have this morning so I didn&#39;t have 
any time to prepare Soylent for work. Once I did get home though I ran 
off to the local Co-op to buy some strawberries. I&#39;ve just finished my 
dinner drink and dear Lord was this a good decision. The aversion I&#39;ve 
had to the slight texture in soylent is completely gone now that I&#39;ve 
mixed in the strawberries. </p>
<p>I think I&#39;m used to the gritty feeling you get when making any blended 
drink with berries, so that offsets anything in my brain that was getting 
disturbed by the slight texture left over in the soylent (which no amount 
of blending seems to remove for me). For future reference (and for anyone
reading this) I bought a quart of strawberries and pre-blended enough of 
them to fill up a 16oz cup. Then I made my soylent by pouring in half of 
a bag, adding a bit of water, then adding the other half and the rest of 
the water. After that I used my emersion blender for a bit, then shook 
the container before adding in the blended strawberries. Finally, I poured 
a cup for myself and blended that just for kicks. The result was a pretty 
smooth meal. The smell of the strawberries easily overpowers the soylent 
powdery smell and I had 0 problems drinking it. I think this is going to 
be how I make my soylent from now on. </p>
<h3>Day 5:</h3><p>Started today off by trying to find a better container for my drink,
ended up finding an old glass jar that&#39;s about the same size as the
water bottle I used yesterday. Glass = No plastic smell which is good.
The consistency of the strawberry soylent is good still, not clumpy once
I shake it in my jar. I packed a bit and took it to work. </p>
<p>Ended up drinking (should I call it eating?) my meal around 12:30 or so
and it filled me up. I had to stay late in the office again though, I
would have originally been home around 6, and that was right around the
time when I was realy wanting some soylent. But I was in the office for
another 4 hours, and my boss bought Pizza for the people working late.
So sadly I had another day without being fully on Soylent like I wanted
to be. Still, when I got home I had a small cup of soylent since I
figure my breakfast and lunch couldn&#39;t have been more than 1000 calories
and my dinner of pizza at work consisted of 4 slices of thin-style pizza 
that probably was at most another 1000.</p>
<p>Today was definitely a change from my previous mentality though. Before
I was trying to figure out how I was going to mix it up to avoid clumps,
today I was just thinking about how good it was with the strawberries.
Tomorrow I&#39;ll bring more Soylent to work if I can find another
container, it will probably another late night and I don&#39;t want to waste
any of this batch like I did the previous.</p>
<h3>Day 6:</h3><p>I really need to buy another glass jar or something. Ended up using my
small blender cup (16oz or so) as a second container for the Soylent I
brought to work today. It was still delicious (yay strawberries!) and I
was quite content having one cup a little after noon and the other one
sometime around 5:30. </p>
<p>It was another late night at work, so I did end up eating some leftover
pizza from the previous night around 8 or 9 since I couldn&#39;t make it
back home to finish off the last of this Soylent batch. Unfortunately
since I worked so late (past midnight) I didn&#39;t get a chance to go to
the store and buy more strawberries, so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to be
able to make more soylent tomorrow or not! </p>
<p>Still, I&#39;m impressed again. Now that I&#39;ve figure&#39;d out how to get past
any clumping and making the neutral taste be something I like, I&#39;m
starting to take more stock in other things. LIke whether or not I&#39;m
hungry. So far I haven&#39;t been hungry, even when two of my meals were
replaced. I&#39;m looking forward to the weekend so I can be sure to get a
full day of only Soylent. </p>
<p>Oh, and I think my bowels have started taking notice. I won&#39;t go into
detail, but there are some differences. Nothing bad, just differences.</p>
<h3>Day 7:</h3><p>Wow has it already been a week? End of the year madness has hit me hard.
But still, got an update on the soylent situation! This morning I poured
what remained of my soylent into a jar and brought it to work. I had it
as part of my lunch with a salad and some type of brocolli rabe. </p>
<p>My flatmate was kind enough to buy me strawberries, but I didn&#39;t have
enough time in the morning to make a new batch of soylent to last me the
day (other people are asleep when I get ready for work, so I wouldn&#39;t
want to run a blender). So I&#39;ll be making that... sometime tomorrow,
probably going in late to work tomorrow since we were all in the office
until 12:30? 1? I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, an interesting observation today: I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m not
hungry when I drink Soylent, but when I do get &quot;real&quot; food (which my
boss buys because they&#39;re a nice person and helps us out when we&#39;re
working late) my stomach rumbles. Not really a problem, but found it
interesting. Once again, looking forward to this weekend when I get to
sit at home, not do anything, and enjoy a few full days of Soylent.</p>
<h3>Day 8:</h3><p>Used the strawberries my house mate was kind of enough to buy me to make
a new batch of Soylent. Even though I forgot to use my emersion blender
on it it still turned out fine from just shaking it which is great.
Enjoyed it at work, and then again later for dinner. I had a normal
breakfast and did go out with friends to grab a drink and had a bit of
pizza, so no all soylent day yet. that will be tomorrow though. Still,
not having any problems with being hungry after substituing in Soylent
for a meal, I guess that&#39;s all the protein in it.</p>
<h3>Day 9:</h3><p>Today was going to be my all soylent day, and I almost managed it!
Breakfast and Lunch were both a cup of strawberry soylent. But then I
watched the match between Germany &amp; Italy, and met up with a friend, so
I ended up having a delicious steak at a restaurant. So once again, I
managed to botch up that whole idea of seeing what happens when I&#39;m only
going off Soylent. </p>
<p>Today there are no such matches though, and tomorrow is a holiday, not
today, so I should be able to do it. We&#39;ll see if I can manage, or if I
get pulled off into the world of fun activities with friends that always
seem to involve food of some kind. Not that I&#39;m really complaining. I
think that a completely Soylent day would be fine, I mean, I&#39;ve almost
done it multiple times already having a few days last week where besides
my breakfast I had just Soylent. </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t really felt any downgrade to my personal self due to it,
despite having an intensely busy week where I was up late for work and
such I still felt normal and good. Whether or not that&#39;s the Soylent
kicking in with all those vitamins I don&#39;t normally get or not is
another matter though. It&#39;s hard to measure that type of thing when
you&#39;re usual schedule is thrown off. So next week should supply a better
guage of the perceived effects.</p>
<h3>Day 10:</h3><p>So much for my plan of only having Soylent all day! Started out with
being lazy and playing video games while having my breakfast cup. But
since I sat around all day I wasn&#39;t that hungry. So I didn&#39;t bother with
lunch, and then I went out to the movies with friends and had some candy
and a soda. Afterward I had some beer and hung out with people chatting
and that was it. So I suppose the only <em>real</em> food I had all day was the
Soylent, but I didn&#39;t have a <em>just</em> soylent day. And tomorrow will
probably be a miss too since it&#39;s a holiday.</p>
<h3>Day 11:</h3><p>No soylent at all today on account of it being a holiday and me being
the grill master. Provided I wake up early tomorrow though, I&#39;ll make a
batch and bring some to work for lunch.</p>
<h3>Day 12:</h3><p>That <em>provided</em> was the main word there. Didn&#39;t have any soylent today,
but I did make a batch for tomorrow!</p>
<h3>Day 13:</h3><p>Back on the bus! Lunch and dinner today were soylent and it feels good 
to be back! Granted I did have friends over again today and we ended up 
running out at 10pm to get chinese food, but hey, still mostly Soylent 
today!</p>
<h3>Day 14</h3><p>Only for lunch today, I had leftover chinese from last night so I had 
that rather than let it slowly rot away in the fridge.</p>
<h3>Day 15</h3><p>Lunch again yesterday was Soylent. I didn&#39;t bother with dinner at all
because I was busy. Tomorrow though, I&#39;ll be making a fresh batch of
Soylent and will be trying to do an all day if I don&#39;t get pulled away
into hanging out with friends.</p>
<h3>Day 16</h3><p>All day of Soylent! Finally, managed to get a single day of just
eating/drinking soylent! Near dinner time I kind of felt like my body
was satisfied, but that it wasn&#39;t filled if that makes sense. Like, I
wasn&#39;t hungry, but my stomach wasn&#39;t used to not having food in it at
the same time. Soylent being mostly liquid probably has something to do
with this feeling I think. </p>
<p>It brings me to wonder if someone only had Soylent, or primarily had it
as their number one source of food for all but maybe one meal per week,
would it negatively impact their stomach&#39;s size or ability to process
more solid foods? </p>
<p>Curiousity aside, I&#39;m a little bummed it took me this long to get a full
day of just soylent in. As of today I feel perfectly fine. Not tired, or
unsatisfied in anyway for that matter. I don&#39;t have any bloated feelings
I might get from over-eating or anything like that. I just kind of
feel... normal? We&#39;ll see if what I had today adversely effects
tomorrow. </p>
<h3>Day 17</h3><p>Breakfast was Soylent today, but then I ended up going out with friends
for lunch, dinner was finishing off some leftovers. </p>
<h3>Day 18</h3><p>Lunch today ended up being some pizza because it was a work thing, but I
finished off the last bit of my Soylent for dinner and then made a new
batch of soylent for tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Day 19</h3><p>Soylent lunch today, but then for Dinner I was out playing puzzled pint
so I had some regular food. </p>
<h3>Day 20</h3><p>Soylent for lunch today, but had a friend over for dinner and games so
we ate some takeout. </p>
<h3>Day 21</h3><p>Soylent for lunch and dinner today! </p>
<h3>Day 22</h3><p>Soylent for lunch, I&#39;m down to my last batch from my initial order.
Luckily the timing seems to have worked out all right, so my next batch
will be arriving sometime next week. In the meanwhile I&#39;ll live off of
my usual supply of pizza rolls. </p>
<p>Also, a friend and I made somewhere around 70 gyoza dumplings last
night. So I have plenty of those for eating whenever I want as well.
Just because I&#39;m partially giving up traditional food doesn&#39;t mean that
I can&#39;t still cook and enjoy making things!</p>
<h3>Day 23</h3><p>Soylent for breakfast, but today was a weekend so we decided to do some
grilling. Did some pretty awesome stuff on the grill, burgers made from
the same filling as the gyoza turned out well. Also tried making some
random frozen food stuffs on the grill wrapped in bacon and that worked
too. Besides the grease fire. </p>
<h3>Day 24</h3><p>Soylent for breakfast again, then relaxed and ate some of the groceries
I bought so that I could conserve my last bit of soylent for the work
day tomorrow. </p>
<h3>Day 24</h3><p>Last drink of my last batch of Soylent. Luckily my order went out
yesterday, so hopefully my new batch of v1.6 will be arriving soon. I
had v1.5 before, so this will be a change once it arrives. I just hope
it arrives soon! It&#39;s way easier to prepare a cup of soylent for lunch
at work than it is to make a sandwich or something else.</p>
<h3>Day 25</h3><p>No soylent :(</p>
<h3>Day 26</h3><p>Still no soylent! I haven&#39;t experienced any slowness or things like that
that I&#39;ve read described, but then again, I didn&#39;t experience any Jimmy
Neutron brainblast style stuff while on it anyway. </p>
<h3>Day 27</h3><p>Box of soylent arrived! I had a work function though, so I didn&#39;t
actually need any for dinner. Still, I made my pitcher for tomorrow and
since it&#39;s the new v1.6 I poured a small amount into a cup to try it
while saving the rest for later. </p>
<p>My initial thoughts on v1.6 is that it&#39;s much <em>much</em> finer than v1.5.
And this has positives and negatives. For example, with v1.5 I was
initially put off by the thick taste at first, but once I started mixing
strawberries in it worked well for me and I started enjoying the
viscosity. With v1.6 it feels more watery, I don&#39;t know if this will
change my sense of soylent to be more of a drink than a shake. It was
very easy for me to substitute a meal with v1.5 because it was a solid
mix between liquid and, uh, solid. I wonder if tomorrow when I have v1.6 for
lunch if I&#39;ll feel just as satisfied? </p>
<p>Also, the <a href="http://files.soylent.com/pdf/soylent-release-notes-1-6-en.pdf">release notes for v1.6</a> note that they&#39;ve replaced the rice
protein entirely with soy protein instead. So the flavor has changed a
bit and the smell too. While drinking my test cup I was swirling it in
my mouth for taste and could feel the fine powder. With v1.5 I felt like
it mixed a bit better and disolved. This might go away with an overnight
sit in the fridge though, so I&#39;ll have to wait until tomorrow lunch and
dinner to really give it a go. The other thing I should probably try is
drinking v1.6 without mixing any strawberries in; the taste has changed
enough that I might be able to drink it without mixing something in,
which would save me a little bit of money. </p>
<p>The smell of v1.6 is much more subdued than v1.5, oh and when I was
using my emersion blender on it it was noticeably different from v1.5.
With the older version I generally had clumps that would linger around
still until I let the drink sit for a while and then mixed again. With
v1.6 it was very smooth and I didn&#39;t see any clumping at all. I didn&#39;t
look too hard before blending, but I imagine that I might be able to get
away with just shaking this version. I&#39;ll have to experiment though.
I&#39;ll take a picture tomorrow of my drink so I can compare it to my
picture of v1.5 near the top of the log. </p>
<h3>Day 28</h3><p>Soylent for lunch! Trivia tonight kind of took over dinner and whatnot,
but I had another glass of v1.6 for lunch today and am continuing to
make my opinion up about it. I read some other reviews to see if anyone 
more eloquent had come up with a description that matched my taste, but 
not much luck there. The biggest thing to me still is how smooth it is;
it&#39;s a massive difference from v1.5 to me. </p>
<p>Someone on the discourse forums for soylent said &quot;sawdust&quot; and I kind 
of see how the texture might be like that, but it definitely doesn&#39;t 
taste like that. I&#39;m thinking about my v1.5 now and thinking to myself 
that it didn&#39;t have the same... hm... grit to it that v1.6 has. The 
newer soylent definitely is smoother, more liquidy, and goes down 
easier. But there is a noticeable grainyness to it that fits the 
&quot;sawdust&quot; description. It&#39;s been a long time since I had kool-aid 
made with the powder, but I wonder if it would be similar if you had
added too much powder?</p>
<p>I definitely notice the addition of soy in the aftertaste though I 
saw lots of complaints about a very bitter aftertaste, to the point 
of some people gagging. But I don&#39;t know, maybe it&#39;s the strawberries 
or something but I really don&#39;t notice any aftertaste besides the 
briefest of a hint of soy that fades quickly. I think I&#39;ll definitely 
make a plain batch of Soylent next, maybe just two scoops or something 
instead of the whole bag. Then again, why mess with success?</p>
<h3>Day 29</h3><p>Soylent for lunch and dinner with no problems. I tried to mull my drink
over in my mouth and think more about it, but I think I summed it up
pretty well in yesterday&#39;s note. I think I found a little bit of the
bitterness, but it&#39;s still not to the same degree that others on
discourse were saying.</p>
<h3>Day 30</h3><p>Soylent for breakfast today, but that was it since I have a friend up
visiting and we&#39;re planning on eating some of those dumplings I made
before among other things. I let him try it and he said &quot;not bad&quot;, which
is pretty much the usual reaction. After looking at the nutritional
information he also said that he thinks it&#39;d be good for hiking.</p>
<h3>Day 31</h3><div style="text-align: center">
    <img src="/images/soylent/2016-07-26.jpg">
</div>

<p>Still had my friend over for a while, so it wasn&#39;t until nighttime that 
I made my newest batch of Soylent. I forewent the strawberries this time
deciding that I&#39;d find out if v1.6 was more palatable than v1.5. I had 
already had dinner (need to use some milk before it went bad, so Mac &amp; 
Cheese it was!), but I made the batch and tried a spoonful of the plain
Soylent. Not bad, creamy as usual, and very mild. I&#39;ll have to give a 
more thoughtful review tomorrow when I have it for lunch.</p>
<h3>Day 32</h3><p>Lunchtime Soylent! I&#39;m still impressed with the smoothness in case you 
can&#39;t tell. The color is the same cream, milky white-ish yellow that the
powder is. And the smell reminds me somewhat of the smell you get when 
you&#39;re mixing flour and water while baking bread... but without the yeast 
part. I had to try <em>really</em> hard to smell my drink though. It&#39;s really a 
light smell. </p>
<p>The taste is exceptionally mild, it&#39;s somewhat hard to believe that it&#39;s 
just water and powder because of how creamy it is, it reminds me of the 
consistency of milk. As far as what the heck I&#39;m tasting is, boy, I don&#39;t 
know. I guess I&#39;d say it tastes like Soylent, because I&#39;m coming up blank 
on what it tastes like, kinda nut-ish? Thinking back on the whole &quot;OMG 
IT&#39;S SO BITTER&quot; thing I read on the forums, I&#39;m <em>not</em> experiencing it at all.
In fact, now that I think about it, the graininess is gone too. So I think
that I used more water (since I wasn&#39;t using the strawberries) really helped 
mix in the rest of the soylent and remove the &quot;sawdust&quot; texture entirely. </p>
<p>I&#39;m trying to remove some of the food I bought when I was waiting for my
new soylent, so I had &quot;normal&quot; food for dinner.</p>
<h3>Day 33</h3><p>Mixed hot chocolate mix with my Soylent today. Super good idea on my
part if I do say so myself. It was creamy, chocolately, and delicious.
Definitely going to have to do this one again, since it&#39;s just some more
powder it mixes in easily and I can keep the amount of water I&#39;ve put in
to make it more creamy. </p>
<p>I had regular soylent for my dinner, tasty. My friend who drinks 2.0
everynow and then and has compared the taste to soy milk. I&#39;ve never had
soy milk, so I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good comparison or not.</p>
<h3>Day 34</h3><p>Regular soylent for lunch again today, definitely don&#39;t have any issues
or even feel like I need strawberries for this. Which is great because
that&#39;s going to save me a good amount of money each week. Soylent for
dinner as well, though I finished my batch today so I supplemented a bit
with some pizza rolls. </p>
<h3>Day 35</h3><p>New batch of regular soylent again! I&#39;m saving <em>a lot</em> of time not having
to cut up and prepare the strawberries for my soylent. Hello more time to 
code! Yes! Nothing crazy to note for lunch, besides having a few ghost 
pepper tortilla chips that someone brought it. Super tasty, very spicy, a 
good way to round out the mild meal I had for sure. </p>
<p>Was a trivia night, so I had a burger for dinner there.</p>
<h3>Day 36</h3><p>Plain soylent again for lunch, but went to an event with a bunch of food
trucks and had a chicken sandwich for dinner. </p>
<h3>Day 37</h3><p>Soylent for breakfast, but ended up having dumplings for lunch (I still
have so many of them from when my housemate and I made them). Then we
chipped in together on some food for dinner for fun. I&#39;ll do my best to
have my meals be soylent tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Day 38</h3><p>Soylent for breakfast. I really didn&#39;t do much at all today so I didn&#39;t 
really have lunch or dinner, just kind of snacked on some peanuts and a
couple leftover wings from the other day. </p>
<h3>Day 39</h3><p>Soylent for lunch and dinner. I&#39;ve decided to trim my breakfast down as 
well, for both budget purposes and to get more soylent in so I can see 
if it has any positive effects.</p>
<h3>Day 40</h3><p>Trimmed out my breakfast beverage, so just had soylent today besides
going to a movie. Feeling good.</p>
<h3>Day 41</h3><p>Soylent for lunch today, no drink again during breakfast so that&#39;s good.
And then I played trivia with people so ended up eating out instead of
having soylent for dinner.</p>
<h3>Day 42</h3><p>Breakfast sandwich again, no beverage though. Then soylent for lunch and
I ate out with a friend again since we both had hard days.</p>
<h3>Day 43</h3><p>Continuing my break off of breakfast beverages, so no real breakfast
today. My usual clerk noticed and got me some water instead which was
sweet of them. Soylent for lunch, and then my friend owed me dinner so I
didn&#39;t have soylent for that. Will probably have a couple leftover
breadsticks tomorrow for dinner along with my soylent.</p>
<h3>Day 44</h3><p>Ended up going out to see Suicide Squad and had dinner before hand with
friends so I only had soylent for lunch today. Also didn&#39;t get to eat my
breadsticks yet either. Maybe I&#39;ll have those tomorrow sometime while
trying to do a full day of soylent again. I figure if I can manage a
full weekend of just Soylent then I&#39;ll treat myself to a pizza or
something on Monday.</p>
<h3>Day 45</h3><p>For breakfast I finished off those leftover breadsticks, and then lunch
and dinner was Soylent. So that makes another day of basically just
Soylent (Would one really count 2 breadsticks as a meal? I suppose it&#39;s
like toast). Tomorrow I&#39;ll try to just do straight soylent, but we&#39;ll
see if that works out. I have a friend over tomorrow, so we&#39;ll see how
that changes things.</p>
<h3>Day 46</h3><p>Breakfast and lunch went as planned. Just soylent. My friend did come
over and we made some nacho&#39;s as a snack, so I wasn&#39;t going to count
that towards my attempt at a full weekend of Soylent, but then <em>another</em>
friend came over out of the blue and we ended up celebrating his return
to the state by going out. So there it was. I was one meal away from an
entirely soylent weekend. Not bad. Maybe next weekend I... oh wait, I
have friends coming up I&#39;ll have to entertain, maybe the weekend after
that...</p>
<h3>Day 47</h3><p>So no pizza today since I didn&#39;t make it all the way through the
weekend with all soylent meals. Oh well, lunch and dinner were both
soylent with no issue. I also walked around again during my lunch break
at work. Gotta try to get some cardio in now that I&#39;m not really running
anymore.</p>
<h3>Day 48</h3><p>Walked again today, soylent for lunch while doing so. I ended up going
out to eat though after seeing a special at a restaurant that piqued my
interest.</p>
<h3>Day 49</h3><p>Pretty much the same as yesterday. Walk &amp; soylent at lunch, then ended
up going out with a friend. And I have plans for a friend visiting this
weekend so that spells doom on that... also, I&#39;m down to one bag of
Soylent somehow! I&#39;ll have to order more.</p>
<h3>Day 50</h3><p>Walk &amp; Lunch as is the routine I&#39;m trying to get into a habit of. Played
trivia with friends so ate out for dinner. Yeesh, so much eating out
this week.</p>
<h3>Day 51</h3><p>Full day of Soylent! </p>
<h3>Day 52</h3><p>Ran out of soylent after having it for breakfast, gotta wait for a
shipment to arrive. But, I went to a cancer charity event and ate good
brisket and food there, so I suppose I&#39;m on a vacation of sorts from
soylent for now.</p>
<h3>Day 53</h3><p>No soylent, still waiting for the new package to arrive, hopefully it
will come soon.</p>
<h3>Day 54</h3><p>Still waiting.</p>
<h3>Day 55</h3><p>Sigh, still waiting for my soylent. I did get a notification that it had
been shipped though. So hopefully it will come soon. I do miss it,
eating &quot;real foid&quot; is good and all, but, I want my soylent.</p>
<h3>Day 56</h3><p>All my meals were non-soylent today, but I did finally get my package in
the afternoon. Which is great. I&#39;m pretty happy to get back into Soylent
and having my designated lunch food and such. </p>
<h3>Day 57</h3><p>Soylent for lunch! So happy. I really did miss it. Not in an &quot;oh I&#39;m 
addicted way&quot; but in the &quot;man, I could really go for some Soylent right
now&quot; kind of way. To be totally honest, it&#39;s a load off my mind trying
to decide where to go for lunch and dinner. So that&#39;s nice to have 
relieved. I have plenty of more important things to think about than what
nutrient&#39;s I&#39;m going to shove down my throat. </p>
<p>Dinner was soylent as well</p>
<h3>Day 58</h3><p>No soylent today because I had made plans to meet up with a friend who&#39;s traveling with me. I dunno when I&#39;m going to get a chance to drink the soylent I just packed.</p>
<h3>Day 59</h3><p>No soylent again, because of travel. </p>
<h3>Day 60</h3><p>No soylent today because of more travel and events. </p>
<h3>Day 61</h3><p>Back in town but too much going on to really make any soylent and I had
to throw out the batch I did make a while ago because it went back.</p>
<h3>Day 62</h3><p>Phew! Back to what I need! Lunch and dinner were both soylent, which I&#39;m
thankful for because I got a lot of exercise today! Walk at lunch being
part of it; but mostly dancing for just under 3 hours with a friend! </p>
<h3>Day 63</h3><p>Lunch was soylent today, with the usual walk. But dinner was fast food
for funzies. Tomorrow will be more soylent though, probably for lunch
and dinner because I have outing plans for Freitag</p>
<h3>Day 64</h3><p>Lunch soylent. Dinner company party.</p>
<h3>Day 65</h3><p>Lunch was a delicious bit of soylent. Finishing off this batch and 
clearing the way for a fresh batch come tomorrow! I say tomorrow 
because dinner plans have kicked in for this weekend. That and my
lunch tomorrow will also probably be regular food. Lame. </p>
<h3>Day 66</h3><p>No soylent today, as expected from yesterday I ended up having &#39;normal&#39;
food all day.</p>
<h3>Day 67</h3><p>Made a new batch of soylent this morning. Unfortunately, work things
occured and then I had no soylent at all, then a bday dinner made me not
get my dinner in either as soylent. Which is sad. Tomorrow though.</p>
<h3>Day 68</h3><p>All day of soylent! Had some for breakfast because I&#39;m going to be on
the go again and need to finish this batch before the day after
tomorrow. Soylent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. No issues with that,
and after going all weekend with &quot;real&quot; food, it&#39;s a good feeling to get
back into my routine and what my body wants. </p>
<h3>Day 69</h3><p>Regular day, besides having some soylent in the morning since I need to finish up this batch before I travel again. And by regular I mean, soylent lunch and dinner.</p>
<h3>Day 70</h3><p>Lunch and dinner again. Had two small, maybe 8oz cups for dinner.</p>
<h3>Day 77</h3><p>Traveling so no soylent.</p>
<h3>Day 78</h3><p>Still travelling.</p>
<h3>Day 79</h3><p>Bet you can&#39;t guess what I&#39;m still doing...</p>
<h3>Day 80</h3><p>Still travelling. </p>
<h3>Day 81</h3><p>Travelling, but home tomorrow, so hopefully soylent will resume.</p>
<h3>Day 82</h3><p>Soylent for lunch today. And dinner. But did get some chicken wings
later on because I felt my body wanted meat. </p>
<h3>Day 83</h3><p>Soylent for lunch and dinner today. Nothing else besides a little bit
of candy.</p>
<h3>Day 84</h3><p>Soylent for lunch, not for dinner though because I had japanese instead. </p>
<h3>Day 85</h3><p>Made a new batch of soylent, but didn&#39;t have any today.</p>
<h3>Day 86</h3><p>Soylent! For lunch and dinner. Though I&#39;m supplementing it with some
leftovers from last night.</p>
<h3>Day 87</h3><p>Lunch and dinner soylent again, you know, besides the slice of pizza I
had last night and along with my dinner today, That&#39;s basically two full
days where my meals were soylent. I wonder if this will keep up this
whole week, then I&#39;ll basically have done a full week of soylent. We&#39;ll
see if I notice anything different from going full-soylent for an
extended period of time.</p>
<h3>Day 88</h3><p>Lunch was soylent, but since this was the last of the batch and it was
rainy and chill out I went and got some soup for dinner. But tomorrow
will be all about plain soylent all day tomorrow!</p>
<h3>Day 89</h3><p>Woke up hungry today. I&#39;ve switched off my breakfast schedule so for the
past two weeks or so I&#39;ve only really been having lunch and dinner
around 12 and 6 respectfully. So it&#39;s interesting to me that I&#39;m hungry
right now, and the only thing I can think of is that instead of having
soylent, which gives me what I need in a cup, I had that soup and
sandwich... So, that&#39;s kind of interesting and motivating in it&#39;s own
way. Either I should have more than what I had last night for dinner
when I switch back to &quot;normal food&quot; for dinners, or I should just eat my
soylent and not worry about being hungry.</p>
<p>Had soylent for lunch as usual and was pretty content with it. But had a
bit of a day of work and ended up going to grab some comfort food for
dinner. So not a full day of soylent as planned but that&#39;s ok. Also, my
new batch of soylent arrived! Woo! Though I still have one pouch left,
so that tells me I need to stop not eating my soylent so often and get
back on that train!</p>
<h3>Day 90</h3><p>Treated myself to my old breakfast routine to celebrate the weekend.
Lunch was soylent as the usual, but then ended up going out to the
movies and grabbed dinner with friends.</p>
<h3>Day 91</h3><p>All soylent day today! Brunch &amp; dinner. </p>
<h3>Day 92</h3><p>Soylent for the first half of the day but then grabbed a drink with a
buddy and watched a sports game so had pub food. </p>
<h3>Day 93</h3><p>Soylent for lunch, had dinner out again though. Tomorrow will be all
soylent though, plus I have a dentist appointment.</p>
<h3>Day 94</h3><p>All soylent day today! Yay!</p>
