<h3>Wait What?</h3><p>Soylent is the brain child of <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/">this guy</a> who made some splashes when he 
decided to <a href="http://robrhinehart.com/?p=298">&quot;stop eating food&quot;</a>. It&#39;s designed to be a meal replacement 
for one, two, or all of your meals as you like it. With the original 
intent of saving time for the busy, and making a healthy alternative to 
other inexpensive food, it&#39;s pretty neat. I was intrigued when I read 
the original blog posts and then decided to try it myself after reading 
<a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2013/08/20/soylent/">this blog post about it</a>. I figure&#39;d that I&#39;d keep a sort of log about 
it to offer my opinion to anyone else who finds this page. I&#39;m not going 
to focus on the quality of writing, and this is more of a stream of 
consciousness than anything else:</p>
<h3>Day 1:</h3><p>Initial thoughts:</p>
<p>Reading all those blogs and anecdotes about it, specifically the fourhourworkweek
post prepared me pretty well. I was lucky enough to get an emersion blender
for free this week and so my drink is pretty smooth. I got the powder
version of v1.5. The smell reminds me like flour. And the taste is like
soy, but creamy like milk at the same time. I can feel a little grit
texture wise, but oddly enough it doesn&#39;t linger in my mouth with any
bad after taste. It goes down smoothly and my initial thought, like many
others I think, is: &quot;Huh, better than expected&quot;.</p>

</div>

<h3>Day 2:</h3><p>Only had a little bit this morning because I had to travel out of state
and didn&#39;t want to lug a large pitcher with me. But the taste was still
fine, still drinking the batch I made on Day 1.</p>
<h3>Day 3:</h3><p>Had another cup of soylent for dinner, had to work late (on a weekend)
and so I didn&#39;t actually have Soylent for lunch like I had originally
planned. I did bring a small bottle of it with me to work, but it seems 
that after a couple days keeping the drink from clumping becomes more 
difficult, and the clumps were really off putting to me. Later, at night, 
I put the remaining Soylent from lunch into my blender and it made it 
drinkable again. While at work I experimented with holding chocolate to 
my nose before drinking, it was interesting how much that changed the 
perception of the taste of soylent. Tomorrow I&#39;ll try putting strawberries 
into it. I also used my blender rather than an emersion blender and had 
better results with removing clumps. The soylent instructions say that 
2 days is typically the max for a batch before it goes rancid so I&#39;ll 
have to make a new one tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Day 4:</h3><p>I woke up much later than I should have this morning so I didn&#39;t have 
any time to prepare Soylent for work. Once I did get home though I ran 
off to the local Co-op to buy some strawberries. I&#39;ve just finished my 
dinner drink and dear Lord was this a good decision. The aversion I&#39;ve 
had to the slight texture in soylent is completely gone now that I&#39;ve 
mixed in the strawberries. </p>
<p>I think I&#39;m used to the gritty feeling you get when making any blended 
drink with berries, so that offsets anything in my brain that was getting 
disturbed by the slight texture left over in the soylent (which no amount 
of blending seems to remove for me). For future reference (and for anyone
reading this) I bought a quart of strawberries and pre-blended enough of 
them to fill up a 16oz cup. Then I made my soylent by pouring in half of 
a bag, adding a bit of water, then adding the other half and the rest of 
the water. After that I used my emersion blender for a bit, then shook 
the container before adding in the blended strawberries. Finally, I poured 
a cup for myself and blended that just for kicks. The result was a pretty 
smooth meal. The smell of the strawberries easily overpowers the soylent 
powdery smell and I had 0 problems drinking it. I think this is going to 
be how I make my soylent from now on. </p>
<h3>Day 5:</h3><p>Started today off by trying to find a better container for my drink,
ended up finding an old glass jar that&#39;s about the same size as the
water bottle I used yesterday. Glass = No plastic smell which is good.
The consistency of the strawberry soylent is good still, not clumpy once
I shake it in my jar. I packed a bit and took it to work. </p>
<p>Ended up drinking (should I call it eating?) my meal around 12:30 or so
and it filled me up. I had to stay late in the office again though, I
would have originally been home around 6, and that was right around the
time when I was realy wanting some soylent. But I was in the office for
another 4 hours, and my boss bought Pizza for the people working late.
So sadly I had another day without being fully on Soylent like I wanted
to be. Still, when I got home I had a small cup of soylent since I
figure my breakfast and lunch couldn&#39;t have been more than 1000 calories
and my dinner of pizza at work consisted of 4 thin-style pizza that
probably was at most another 1000.</p>
<p>Today was definitely a change from my previous mentality though. Before
I was trying to figure out how I was going to mix it up to avoid clumps,
today I was just thinking about how good it was with the strawberries.
Tomorrow I&#39;ll bring more Soylent to work if I can find another
container, it will probably another late night and I don&#39;t want to waste
any of this batch like I did the previous.</p>
<h3>Day 6:</h3><p>I really need to buy another glass jar or something. Ended up using my
small blender cup (16oz or so) as a second container for the Soylent I
brought to work today. It was still delicious (yay strawberries!) and I
was quite content having one cup a little after noon and the other one
sometime around 5:30. </p>
<p>It was another late night at work, so I did end up eating some leftover
pizza from the previous night around 8 or 9 since I couldn&#39;t make it
back home to finish off the last of this Soylent batch. Unfortunately
since I worked so late (past midnight) I didn&#39;t get a chance to go to
the store and buy more strawberries, so I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m going to be
able to make more soylent tomorrow or not! </p>
<p>Still, I&#39;m impressed again. Now that I&#39;ve figure&#39;d out how to get past
any clumping and making the neutral taste be something I like, I&#39;m
starting to take more stock in other things. LIke whether or not I&#39;m
hungry. So far I haven&#39;t been hungry, even when two of my meals were
replaced. I&#39;m looking forward to the weekend so I can be sure to get a
full day of only Soylent. </p>
<p>Oh, and I think my bowels have started taking notice. I won&#39;t go into
detail, but there are some differences. Nothing bad, just differences.</p>
<h3>Day 7:</h3><p>Wow has it already been a week? End of the year madness has hit me hard.
But still, got an update on the soylent situation! This morning I poured
what remained of my soylent into a jar and brought it to work. I had it
as part of my lunch with a salad and some type of brocolli rabe. </p>
<p>My flatmate was kind enough to buy me strawberries, but I didn&#39;t have
enough time in the morning to make a new batch of soylent to last me the
day (other people are asleep when I get ready for work, so I wouldn&#39;t
want to run a blender). So I&#39;ll be making that... sometime tomorrow,
probably going in late to work tomorrow since we were all in the office
until 12:30? 1? I don&#39;t know.</p>
<p>Anyway, an interesting observation today: I&#39;ve noticed that I&#39;m not
hungry when I drink Soylent, but when I do get &quot;real&quot; food (which my
boss buys because they&#39;re a nice person and helps us out when we&#39;re
working late) my stomach rumbles. Not really a problem, but found it
interesting. Once again, looking forward to this weekend when I get to
sit at home, not do anything, and enjoy a few full days of Soylent.</p>
<h3>Day 8:</h3><p>Used the strawberries my house mate was kind of enough to buy me to make
a new batch of Soylent. Even though I forgot to use my emersion blender
on it it still turned out fine from just shaking it which is great.
Enjoyed it at work, and then again later for dinner. I had a normal
breakfast and did go out with friends to grab a drink and had a bit of
pizza, so no all soylent day yet. that will be tomorrow though. Still,
not having any problems with being hungry after subtituing in Soylent
for a meal, I guess that&#39;s all the protein in it.</p>
<h3>Day 9:</h3><p>Today was going to be my all soylent day, and I almost managed it!
Breakfast and Lunch were both a cup of strawberry soylent. But then I
watched the match between Germany &amp; Italy, and met up with a friend, so
I ended up having a delicious steak at a restaurant. So once again, I
managed to botch up that whole idea of seeing what happens when I&#39;m only
going off Soylent. </p>
<p>Today there are no such matches though, and tomorrow is a holiday, not
today, so I should be able to do it. We&#39;ll see if I can manage, or if I
get pulled off into the world of fun activities with friends that always
seem to involve food of some kind. Not that I&#39;m really complaining. I
think that a completely Soylent day would be fine, I mean, I&#39;ve almost
done it multiple times already having a few days last week where besides
my breakfast I had just Soylent. </p>
<p>I haven&#39;t really felt any downgrade to my personal self due to it,
despite having an intensely busy week where I was up late for work and
such I still felt normal and good. Whether or not that&#39;s the Soylent
kicking in with all those vitamins I don&#39;t normally get or not is
another matter though. It&#39;s hard to measure that type of thing when
you&#39;re usual schedule is thrown off. So next week should supply a better
guage of the perceived effects.</p>
<h3>Day 10:</h3><p>So much for my plan of only having Soylent all day! Started out with
being lazy and playing video games while having my breakfast cup. But
since I sat around all day I wasn&#39;t that hungry. So I didn&#39;t bother with
lunch, and then I went out to the movies with friends and had some candy
and a soda. Afterward I had some beer and hung out with people chatting
and that was it. So I suppose the only <em>real</em> food I had all day was the
Soylent, but I didn&#39;t have a <em>just</em> soylent day. And tomorrow will
probably be a miss too since it&#39;s a holiday.</p>
<h3>Day 11:</h3><p>No soylent at all today on account of it being a holiday and me being
the grill master. Provided I wake up early tomorrow though, I&#39;ll make a
batch and bring some to work for lunch.</p>
