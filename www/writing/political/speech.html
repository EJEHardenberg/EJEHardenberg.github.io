			<h3>Freedom of Speech vs HateSpeech</h3><p><strong>
Disclaimer: I am discussing FreeSpeech in the U.S.A only.
</strong></p>
<p>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard this before on the internet: &quot;Free speech man! I
can say what I want!&quot;. You may have shaken your head and walked away,
you also may have started to respond and argue on the internet. And,
well, <a href="http://xkcd.com/386/">we all know how well that works</a>. </p>
<p>Whatever this internet troll has said, the fact of the matter is that they are almost
always correct about their right to Free speech. It does not matter if
you are offended. I&#39;m sorry, but it doesn&#39;t. If something as simple as
being offended by something someone else has said (which is very easy)
constituted a violation of the First Amendment, then we&#39;d all be jailed
by some thin-skinned person with a lawyer. And while I don&#39;t always
enjoy seeing things that offend me, I am fully aware that people can
voice their own opinion, so long as it is simply voicing it. </p>
<p>Where you step into the areas outside of your rights is when your
words become a call to action that can harm someone. The Supreme Court
only counts speech as hateful if it leads to &quot;imminent violence&quot;. For
example, in the case of Synder v. Phelps in 2011, the Westboro Baptist
Church (WBC) was protesting with signs that offended people (myself included),
it was brought to court and you know what? The Supreme Court sided with
Phelps, the head of the WBC. Protecting their
constitutional right to say the things they did regardless of whom they
offended. This decision was made because the WBC was not promoting any
sort of imminent violence. </p>
<p>Sometimes you might hear a funny quip in a cartoon or western show calling
out to another that &quot;them&#39;s be fighting words!&quot;. Oddly enough, this is
actually one of the first things which Freedom of Speech does <em>not</em>
protect. Fighting words are inflammatory speech designed to cause the
hearer to retaliate back, typically in a physical manner or in some way
that would be injurious to themselves. For example, if you walk into a
black neighborhood and start calling them all racial slurs, not only
are you likely a racist, but you&#39;re inciting them to attack you:
fighting words in the truest sense. In that case, you are not protected
by a Freedom of Speech for being a bigot, and are engaging in Hate
Speech.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
<p>Besides fighting words, threats, child pornography, obscenity,
defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional emotional distress all
fall into the category of exclusions of Freedom of Speech. Let me give
an example of each: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>True Threats</strong><sup>[2]</sup>: this is obvious, if I say I will kill you, that is not
protected by the 1st amendment as free speech. </li>
<li><strong>C.P</strong>: I feel this is obvious, but you cannot post, NOR distribute
(even inadvertently) any depiction of such things. </li>
<li><strong>Obscenity</strong>: If you send George Bush a shopped image of him having sex
with a rabbit or something, that&#39;s not gonna be protected.</li>
<li><strong>Defamation</strong>: Slandering someones name through lies or running a smear
campaign in writing (libel).</li>
<li><strong>Invasion of Privacy</strong>: on the internet this means &quot;doxxing&quot; someone, or
releasing <em>non-public</em> information about where they live, their phone
number, or any other personal information related. </li>
<li><strong>Intentional Emotional Distress</strong>: If you threw firecrackers near a
war veteran whom you knew had PTSD, or sent letters to a family
falsely stating a relative had died.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not all of these are criminal offenses. Defamation, invasion of privacy,
and intentional infliction of emotional distress are what&#39;s known as
&#39;Torts&#39;: which are civil wrongs that you can be sued for as they breach
one of your rights. So you&#39;ll get your pants sued off for defaming
someone, but you&#39;re not likely to go to jail for it (is my
understanding). </p>
<p>There&#39;s a lot more to cover here besides just Torts, such as public
employee speech, student speech, government speech, dealings with
national security, and even your voice in patent law. But I&#39;m really more focused
on the internet culture around free speech than this. And while
obviously these things are related, I don&#39;t want to go to far down the
legal rabbit whole. So let&#39;s get back to the topic we started with armed
with our new knowledge: arguing with someone on the internet. </p>
<p>Let&#39;s take youtube and news article comments as an example. On many
controversial videos or stories people tend to pop out of the cracks and
voice their opinion. <strong>This is a good thing</strong>. Talking and debating
articulate points is generally beneficial and educational to all
involved. However, this is the internet, and therefore you&#39;re going to
run into something anyone under the age of 30 will know about. <em>Trolls</em>. </p>
<p>A troll is someone who attempts to get a rise out of people for
personal amusement. There&#39;s nothing inherently wrong with this, it&#39;s not
uncommon to see siblings irk one another or even schoolchildren tease.
In my opinion, teasing is an important part of anyone&#39;s growth as it teaches one to
take criticism, build up a bit of a thicker skin, and in general prepare
for the much harder situations down the line like messing up and needing
to own up to it. A simple troll who hops onto a forum and starts playing
devil&#39;s advocate and saying silly things is not in anyway morally wrong.
No matter how frustrating you find it. Why? Because of fighting words.
Because there is no threat of imminent violence. Because in the United
States v. American Library Association and in Reno v. ACLU, the full
protection of the 1st amendment extends to the internet.</p>
<p>This does not, however, give a troll the freedom to go onto a person&#39;s
video and begin commenting about things that may cause emotional
distress. This is an extremely grey area, for example, one does not
always know what might cause someone distress. The thing about torts,
besides being a funny word, is that they can often be unintentional or
due to negligence. An emotional distress can be caused by intentional OR
reckless disregard, and both of these are sufficient for a tort case to
go through.</p>
<p>The other grey area here is on the side of the distressed party, the
reaction <em>must</em> be severe. Which is based upon the intensity, duration,
and any physical reactions to the stress. Almost always, mental
disorders that have been documented by a mental health professional are
required for an actual tort case. Otherwise you&#39;re pretty much told,
correctly, that someone criticizing you on the internet is not a crime.</p>
<p>So what does this all mean when it comes to our youtube arguing troll?
Or even to the unknowing internet browser who happens to comment
something that &#39;triggers&#39; someone? Is it harassment? Should they be
sued? Is there more than a misunderstanding here or an accidental
infringement? Well, one of the elements of the tort is that the actions
the defendant (the one who has been accused of causing emotional
distress) took were extreme or outrageous. A simple bit of clever
prauding at peoples soft spots to get a rise out of them is not extreme,
so it doesn&#39;t fall under that. Not to mention that the actions of the
troll have to actually cause emotional distress, not the actions of a
large group of people, but the actions of that specific person. </p>
<p>Now what about something else on the internet? Parody? You see it all
the time, autotuned videos of speeches, silly comics or drawings of
public figures, even fanfiction sometimes. Are these examples of
Hate Speech, slander, or libel? Once again, the answer is no. Parody is
actually protected by the first amendment, and was in the case of
Hustler v. Falwell when the surpreme court decided public figures do not
have protection from parody. One of the things people seem to not
realize, is that the moment you create a youtube video you have put
yourself out there as a possible limited public figure. </p>
<p>This is not victim shaming, a limited public figure is anyone who
engages in actions which generate publicity within a narrow area of
interest. Guess what? A youtube channel or show falls into this
category. Therefore parody of youtubers is allowed, and hell, sometimes
you get some pretty amusing stuff from it. This also brings in the fun
realm of caricature and other political art. People get pretty creative
about these things, and I think it&#39;s quite humorous and a good thing,
afterall, anyone with a good sense of humor will recognize the parody
and laugh along before getting back to business of discussing whatever
niche they&#39;re in. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve talked about the innocuous type of troll. Not the kind of person
who goes out of their way to attack someone. I don&#39;t refer to these
people as trolls, because that&#39;s not anywhere close to my definition of
it. A troll is just someone who finds amusement in riling someone up for
&quot;the lulz&quot;, and I have no problem with that and find it pretty funny
sometimes. But someone who verbally attacks and harasses someone is not
a troll, they are a harasser. And should be called as such. Language is
very important as it defines how we think, express ourselves, and
justify our actions. </p>
<p>So now you&#39;re a little more educated, about freedom of speech. And so I
want to ask you now, what do you think <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEsMCSGBjCI">this video</a>? Do you believe an
April fools joke was meant to cause emotional distress? Do you believe 
Jensine Anahita was justified in calling Title IX? If you&#39;ve read this
all the way through, I wonder if you agree with me when I say that
jokes, parody, and satire is protected by the 1st Amendment. Do you
believe that the memo sent around by Linda Bennet was a good intention
or thought policing? Chat in the comments below about it, follow the 1st
amendment and try not to troll each other too much ;) </p>
<p><strong>
If I&#39;ve gotten something wrong, feel free to point it out along with a
relevant source and I&#39;ll revise.

Another example of fighting words is calling any sort of cultural
identity dead and dehumanizing said culture. A la #GamerGate. But I
digress since this piece is not about #GamerGate.

A true threat must have probably cause and intent behind it, simply
saying something typically doesn&#39;t net you a jailcell, as shown in
[Watts v. United States]
