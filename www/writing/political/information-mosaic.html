			<h2><a href="disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></h2>
			<h3>The Information Mosaic</h3><p><em>&quot;If you have nothing to hide, you have nothing to fear&quot;</em> </p>
<p>You&#39;ve likely heard this before, you may even have voiced the notion
yourself. I am here to tell you why, and how, this seemingly logical
statement is full of more bullshit than I, or any other computing
professional with a moral conscious, can stand. To begin. here&#39;s a
story:</p>
<p>A former professor of journalism at Columbia University, Peter Kimball,
was denied government posts, academic appointments, and applications for
passports. Why? Because a comment from a referee snowballed into a
massive document portraying Kimball as a communist sympathizer and an
undesirable citizen. All it took was two events, an application to a
government position where one reference questioned his political views,
and rejecting a government position in favor of one at a newspaper. A 
few small pieces of information, and over the course of 30 years, this
man&#39;s file showed up on the desk of J. Edgar Hoover.</p>
<p>The worst part? Kimball <strong>didn&#39;t even know</strong> that allegations had been
made against him. Only a Freedom of Information Act revealed the history
of surveillance that plagued nearly his entire career. He wrote a book,
<em>The File</em> which you can read if you&#39;re interested. Kimball didn&#39;t try
to hide anything, yet hidden from him were deliberate distortions of his
character. Ask yourself now, <em>did Kimball try to hide anything? did he
have anything to fear?</em>. In my opinion, being classified as: a 
&quot;dangerous national security risk of doubtful loyalty to the U.S.
government and institutions&quot; would concern me, I would be afraid of how
the government would want to deal with this &quot;danger&quot;. Yet, nothing was
hidden, and still he was seen as suspect and guilty.</p>
<p>But it&#39;s not always targeted surveillance that causes problems for
individuals, and it&#39;s not always applications to government positions
either. No, sometimes the person being affected is &quot;the little guy&quot;, and
all they did was match a record stored on a computer somewhere. Any type
of record keeping on citizens can lead to error, and can lead to matters
of personal security. </p>
<p>The Department of Motor Vehicles has a list of addresses for citizens,
sometimes for a fee, sometimes for free, these addresses can be
acquired. Rebecca Schaeffer of California was murdered by an obsessed
fan who used the DMV records to find where she lived. <em>Nothing to hide,
nothing to fear</em>, except for your life in this instance.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s an actress you say, no way could that happen to me, to &quot;the
little guy&quot;. Martin Lee Dement spent two years in Los Angeles County
jail because the Automated Latent Print System that matches fingerprints
matched his to a suspected criminal. If it wasn&#39;t for manual checks done
to another suspect&#39;s fingerprints he wouldn&#39;t have been cleared.
Incorrect records of finger prints, something which can be done for
jobs, misdemeanors, or military service, resulted in a man losing 2
years of his life for nothing. <em>Nothing to hide, nothing to fear</em>. </p>
<p>Government positions, public records, and mismatched database records
aren&#39;t a common occurence you say? You&#39;re still not convinced? Ok.
Here&#39;s the scenario I paint for friends who I talk to about these types
of things in order to sketch the gravity of information. You&#39;ve been
employed for a number of years by MegaCorp Incorporate. Recently, you
had your annual check up and were diagnosed with cancer. It&#39;s not
benign and your doctor informs you that you&#39;ll need chemotherapy to
fight it. </p>
<p>Work&#39;s been really busy lately so you&#39;ve been using your company laptop
for private correspondence and to tell your mother about these things
when you had a chance. However, you don&#39;t want to tell your friends
quite yet. You&#39;ve done a few searches online for information about
cancer and purchased a book about it. To avoid the concern from friends,
you also buy a wig to avoid questions about your hair loss. Once you&#39;ve
been on chemotherapy for a while, you&#39;ve lost some weight and take more
sick days than usual. </p>
<p>When taken individually, a book purchase, an internet search, a wig
purchase, increased sick days, and weight loss mean little. After all, a
book purchase on cancer could be interest, or perhaps for a friend. A
search could be prompted by an article or passing curiousity. A wig
purchase could be part of a halloween costume, or if out of season, a
convention or costumed event. An increase in sick days could be a result
of sickness going around your child&#39;s school, or a bug in the office.
And weight loss could be the result of exercise or diet. </p>
<p>But when taken in context. A book about cancer and a wig is suspicious.
An increase in sick days combined with this? An increase in interest of
dealing with cancer or finding support groups online? This type of
information mosaic combines to create a full picture of an individual
struggling to deal with a new illness. And one which they would have
preferred to keep private. </p>
<p>Yet, when it comes to the internet, <a href="https://www.eff.org/press/releases/human-rights-watch-sues-dea-over-bulk-collection-americans-telephone-records">government collection of records</a>,
and advertisement related tracking, this type of monitoring is exactly
what&#39;s being built. The ability to harvest and monitor behavior online,
and to build profiles of individuals, is sold to the highest bidder,
with 0 oversight into how the information is used. If you&#39;ve ever read
anything about privacy you&#39;ve no doubt heard the phrase: <em>&quot;You are the
product&quot;</em>. When it comes to Facebook, the reason your profile is free is
because <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/breakout/3-ways-facebook-ipo-exploit-users-172215377.html">your data can be sold</a>. It is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/us/politics/bipartisan-backlash-grows-against-domestic-surveillance.html">used by advertisers</a>, and
despite their protests, the government can request the information on
users and tell the company to be <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/18/facebook-apple-nsa-transparency_n_3617251.html">quiet about the request itself</a>. </p>
<p>You might think that searching for something online can&#39;t be tracked
back to you. After all, so many people request information all the time.
There&#39;s no way that it could be shown to be coming from you, right? No.
In order to &quot;deliver you the most useful and relevant ads&quot; Google will
<a href="https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6603">use your search queries, sites you visit, and other Google Account
information to show you more relevant ads</a>. This data collection in
order to serve you advertisements is what powers most of the profit on
the web. Companies pay top dollar to get their ads in front of you, when
you click them, or you click that inflamatory headline that leads you
one step closer to them. you leave a trail of information behind you.
Individually, these pieces mean nothing, just like in the cancer patient
case, but together? Together your internet usage can paint a clean
enough picture that a marketing agent can tell your political leanings,
they can tell what your interests are, where you might have traveled,
what food you like to eat, your age group, your gender. </p>
<p>If two incidents in the life of Peter Kimball, pre-internet era, can
result in 30 years of suspicion, what does a <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/07/dea-bulk-telephone-surveillance-operation/70808616/">decade of spying on
innocent americans</a> enable? When a government can force
the marketing data attached to your name, your personal google profile,
that contains sites you visit, search queries, and mail contents from a
company by request, without informing you, what file is being built for
you? With the era of information technology allowing instant querying of
gigabytes of information against these databases, is it paranoia to be
concerned?</p>
<p>It is not a question of whether or not you have anything to hide, but if
it is even possible to hide in the first place. In 1971 the National
Security Agency requested a high-temperature incinerator to dispose of
the printouts and documents it generated each day. The incinerator was
capable of destroying six tons of paper per hour. And was required to be
capable of destroying thirty six tons in any eight hour shift. At that
time, the agency was able to intercept and analyze 70% of all telephone,
telex, data, and radio transmissions generated <em>on Earth</em>. As the
internet came into existence this number dropped, but with the amount of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_government_mass_surveillance_projects">governments focused on surveillance</a>, it surely has been rising,
perhaps one of the most notable cases being the <a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/2014/05/19/data-pirates-caribbean-nsa-recording-every-cell-phone-call-bahamas/">recording of every cell
phone call in the bahamas</a>. </p>
<p>One might ask, why? What justifies these actions? The age old excuse is
security. And to some extent, surveillance can legitimately help <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/04/07/dea-bulk-telephone-surveillance-operation/70808616/">track
drug dealers</a> and cartels, but the cost of these procedures is huge.
Even if the databases created during these times are purged after their
use, the information is shared between agencies. It is duplicated. Any
good system administrator will create back ups, and just because we
think of <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/">government websites as incompetant</a> doesn&#39;t mean that they
are. There are good people working there, and many take their job very
seriously. Once the data is made in one agency, it will flow to others
in the form of <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/08/dea-and-nsa-team-intelligence-laundering">&quot;tips&quot;</a>, and there is no stopping that. </p>
<h4>A Call to my fellow Computer Scientists</h4><p>The only way we can do anything about it is through an overhaul of the
system. Clear guidelines and channels of communication, more
transparency, and above all else, <em>to stop treating human beings as
numbers in a database</em>. An ID number or social security number is not a
person, and it&#39;s easy to forget these things when dealing with large
volumes of data. The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct section
2.7 states: </p>
<blockquote>
    <strong>Improve public understanding of computing and its
consequences</strong>
    Computing professionals have a responsibility to share technical
knowledge with the public by encouraging understanding of computing,
including the impacts of computer systems and their limiations. This
imperative implies an obligation to counter any false views related to
computing.
</blockquote>

<p>To any person who dares call themself a member of the Computer Science
community, this simple section demands we inform our friends, families,
and anyone who will listen about the impact of our work. An obligation
to counter false narratives or corporate and government agents who seek
to undermine the 4th amendment and reduce our humanity to an entry in a
database. More so, the ACM Code explicitly states in section 1.7:</p>
<blockquote>
<strong>Respect the privacy of others</strong>
Computing and communications technology enables the collection and
exchange of personal information on a scale unprecedented in the history
of civilization. Thus there is increased potential for violating the
privacy of individuals and groups. It is the responsibility of
professionals to maintain the privacy and integrity of data describing
invididuals...
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://workplace.stackexchange.com/a/43796">We are torn everyday</a> between our jobs, pressure from management, and our
conscious. As engineers we have a duty to our employers, and we have a
duty to our fellow people. Advertisement problems might be fascinating,
but losing site of the human element in favor of trying new technology
is tantamount to casting aside moral judgement. Capturing the data
flowing in and out of an entire country poses a unique and fascinating
set of challenges, but curiousity and the desire to see if we can do it
should never override the rights of another human being. </p>
<p>Information technologies enable the creation of the information mosaic, but
they must also put the glass around the painting and protect the pieces from
harm and prying eyes. The <a href="http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics">ACM has guidelines and a code of ethics</a>, this should be read
by <em>everyone</em> who enters into the computing field. I have stood in the
way of a marketing department before and refused to implement changes
based on this code. And I expect anyone who cares for others, and for
the consequences of their actions to do the same. Empowerment of the user
is something many developers often tote, it&#39;s time that we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkTb7Pe2MtY">fight for the
user</a>. </p>
<p>This is not a call to protest in the streets, it is simply a request to
have integrity in your day to day work. And through collective effort,
the industry can be made more aware and these issues mitigated so that
the average citizen can be a background piece in the painting, and not
the subject.</p>
