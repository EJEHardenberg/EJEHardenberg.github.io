<h4>Why I picked up this book</h4>
<p>In light of <a href="https://medium.com/@aquapendulum/my-letter-to-jason-schreier-about-gamergate-ethics-f890d357188">recent events</a> I have increasingly been confronted with
a lot of ideals crashing. Ideals, which in my opinion, have common
ground and could easily stand together. Yet the radical few always seem
to destroy the chance of starting anew. </p>
<p>Realizing that has been massively important to me. So let me say this, a
single Radical Feminist should never define your viewpoint on the
movement as a whole. It is the actions of the majority that must be
considered. Yet often it is only one bad apple that spoils the bunch.
When I was in college I was required to take two &quot;diversity classes&quot;.
These classes were a univerity&#39;s top-down approach to solving a bottom-up
problem. To sum it up in one sentence: the teacher ruined feminism for
me. </p>
<p>Fast forward 2.5 years. After discovering <a href="https://twitter.com/CHSommers">Christina Hoff Sommers</a>
through [my interest in an ethical reform in gaming journalism], I
started to pull away from my preconceived notions, watching her <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLytTJqkSQqtr7BqC1Jf4nv3g2yDfu7Xmd">videos</a>
showed me a feminist I had seen little of before. While I had been exposed
to a misandrist through the aforementioned class, here I was exposed
to someone using statistics and surveys to speak to me in my own terms:
rationality and logic. </p>
<p>So <strong>I walked into my local bookstore&#39;s women&#39;s studies section</strong> for
the first time in three years and looked for one of her books. Sadly, I
didn&#39;t find one, but I did spy Norah Vincent&#39;s &quot;Self Made Man&quot; sitting
on the shelf. If there&#39;s such thing as fate in this world, then it
certainly sent me this book. </p>
<p>One of the things my friends know about me, and to which my parents
provide increasing disapproval each year, is that I enjoy cross dressing
during halloween or conventions. </p>

</small></p>
<p>It&#39;s not always fun, being called rude things like &quot;ladyman&quot; from a
group of drunk girls was painful, but it was and <em>always</em> is a worthwhile
experience, even if sometimes upsets me.  The moment Norah Vincent&#39;s book 
made it&#39;s appearance to me and I realized it was about a woman doing what 
I do sometimes, from the other side, I had to have it. </p>
<p>What shared experiences would we have? Boy oh boy, I couldn&#39;t have even 
fathomed how hard this book would hit home in some places. So without 
further disgressions, let&#39;s talk about how I&#39;m going to approach this:</p>
<p><div id="layout"></div></p>
<h4>The format of my review and thoughts</h4>
<p>Thoroughness is something to look for in a review of anything, so
despite how long it may make this post, I&#39;m going to do my best to be
thorough. This means a mini review on the first 3 chapters of the book 
and my reactions, agreements, disagreements, and general thoughts on 
each. There are 8 total chapters, all worth reading, but I figure talking
about 3 of them is enough. If you&#39;re looking for a decently comprehensive 
review then here it is:</p>
<p><div id="chapter1"></div></p>
<h4>The Whys and Hows of It</h4>
<p>The start of the book is a simple introduction to why Mrs* Vincent
wrote the book. How her time as a child and a rough coming of age
throughout puberty and college shaped the decisions that eventually led
her to crossdress for a year and a half. Also, she discloses that the
book is not a research study on gender differences, but rather <strong>one</strong>
woman&#39;s <em>experience</em> of a social culture of which she had never been a
part of. </p>
<p>This chapter goes over a few things that I immediately related to,
learning how to use makeup to disguise oneself, binding gendered parts
(for the author: her breasts, for me: my penis), minding gender cues and
getting voice training. All of these were things I as a reader could
immediately relate to (though she had theatre help while I mainly used
youtube), and for someone who doesn&#39;t crossdress: I think they&#39;d find it
fascinating what someone needs to do to portray themselves as someone
else, and accept the person looking at them in the mirror as someone
else. </p>
<p>One of the things that struck me, that must be talked about (especially
since this is the opinion blog on my site), is the section in the
beginning about eye contact. From her perspectives of both male and
female I qoute:</p>
<p>(Pg 2 &amp; 3)</p>
<blockquote>

As a woman, you couldn&#39;t walk down those streets invisibly. You were an
object of desire or at least semiprurient interest to the men who waited
there, even if you weren&#39;t pretty - that, or you were just another pussy
to be put in its place. Either way, their eyes followed you all the way
up and down the street, never wavering, asserting their dominance as a
matter of course. If you were female and you lived there, you got used
to being stared down because it happened every day and there wasn&#39;t
anything you could do about it.

<br>

But that night in drag, we walked by those same stoops and doorways and
bodegas. We walked by those same groups of men. Only this time they
didn&#39;t stare. On the contrary, when they met my eyes they looked away
immediately and concertedly and never looked back. It was astoundind,
the difference, the respect they showed me by <em>not</em> looking at me, by
purposely not staring.

<br>

That was it. That was what had annoyed me so much about meeting their
gaze as a woman, not the desire, if that was ever there, but the
disrespect, the entitlement. It was rude, and it was meant to be rude,
and seeing those guys looking away deferentially when they thought I was
male, I could validate in retrospect the true hostility of their former
stares.
<br>

But that wasn&#39;t all there was to it. There was something more than
respect being communicated in their averted gaze, something subtler,
less direct. It was more like a disinclination to show disrespect. For
them, to look away was to decline a challenge, to adhere to a code of
behavior that kept the peace and the pecking order among male animals.
To look another male in the eye and hold his gaze is to invite conflict,
either that or accept the status quom to leave each man to his tiny
sphere of influence, the small buffer of pride and poise that surrounds
and keeps him.

</blockquote>

<p>When I first read this I found myself very conflicted. I took offense
to her &quot;pecking order among male animals&quot;, in it I saw a slight
inclination to view the male as subhuman, other language in the chapter
also made me feel that she saw herself as some sort of enlightened pinacle
of moral superiority coming to visit the savages. </p>
<p>But I continued reading, and I decided to ignore anything that
immediately started to offend me and instead to look into <strong>what</strong> she
was saying and not <strong>how</strong> she was doing it. Once that position was
taken, I could follow and agree with her in many places. For example,
during my first cross-dressing experience I was catcalled and wolf
whistled at by a group of fratboys on a porch. <em>This amused me to no
end</em> because the thrill of passing as a woman and fooling these
blowhards made me laugh. Throughout that night the difference in treatment 
by friends and strangers was <em>extremely</em> evident to me. Some good, some 
bad. I received more looks and was noticed more by people walking down 
the street. I felt the eyes on me. And the funny thing was that many 
were women, sizing me up in what felt like a competition of some kind. </p>
<p>In the same way as Mrs Vincent found a difference in treatment, so did I. 
Having cross-dressed every halloween since, I&#39;ve started to build up my 
own personal experience of life through the eyes of a woman. While no way 
nearly as comprehensive as her&#39;s, I found similarity in many of her 
expressions about the pyschological affects it can have to hold two views 
on something at the same time. Wondering: would I be treated this way if 
I was X or Y? And there is definite truth in her words when she discusses 
the value of perception and your own projection. If you go into a scene 
awkward and uncomfortable, trying to make sure no one finds our you&#39;re 
not what you are trying to appear as, the cracks show, but if you assert 
yourself as being a man (in Mrs Vincent&#39;s case) and presenting that to 
the people you&#39;re talking to, then you&#39;ll see people accept you as what 
you say you are. </p>
<p>This chapter even by itself, despite simply being an introductorary 12 or
something pages, is worth getting the book for. And the rest of the book 
dives far deeper into the rabbit-hole of masculinity. I&#39;m curious what 
others think about her analysis of eye contact, it would be very interesting 
to hear both men and women&#39;s responses in the comments below.</p>
<p>*<small>I say Mrs becuase there is a dedication to her wife at the
start of the book, I assume this is correct title use, but if not let me
know in the comments below</small></p>
<p><div id="chapter2"></div></p>
<h4>Friendship, Manning up, and Closeness</h4>
<p>The second chapter details how the author infiltrated a men&#39;s bowling league. 
An area which she found a group of men who, despite her being poor at
the sport, took her under their wing. At first, Mrs. Vincent was wary and
nervous:</p>
<blockquote>
    My eyes blurred in panic. I didn&#39;t see anything. I remember being 
    aware only of a wave of noise and imagined distrust coming at me
    from undistinguishable faces. Probably only one or two people
    actually turned to look, but it felt as if every pair of eyes in the
    place had landed on me and stuck.
</blockquote>

<p>However, upon meeting her teammates she is instantly welcomed and made to
feel welcome with a simple gesture:</p>
<blockquote>
    There was something so warm and bonded in this handshake. Receiving 
    it was a rush, an instant inclusion in a camaraderie that felt very 
    old and practiced.
    <br>
    ...
    <br>
    This solidarity of sex was something that feminism tried to teach us,
    and something, it now seemed to me, that men figured out and perfected 
    a long time ago. On some level men didn&#39;t need to learn or remind themselves
    that brotherhood was powerful. It was just something they seemed to know.
</blockquote>

<p>While one of the men doesn&#39;t greet her with as much enthusiam, simpy nodding
from across the table, throughout the months at the league she observes this 
man&#39;s son being taught some of the stereotypical rules of manhood. Bob&#39;s son, Alex,
is a chatty kid who, like many children, will blather your ear off if given the
chance. During her time in the league, Mrs. Vincent observes what she percieves 
as Alex&#39;s trial and error eduction. Where the boy is &quot;thrown to the wolves&quot; and
taught through teasing and thickening of his skin. The irony that both the boy 
and author were going through a sort of tutorial in mandhood isn&#39;t lost, and a
good number of interesting insights are given.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Mrs. Vincent assumed the worst in these men, as they all 
represented the stereotypical white man (plumber, construction worker, etc). In
her own words:</p>
<blockquote>
    Exposing my own prejudices, I had expected these guys to be filled with 
    virulent hatred for anyone who wasn&#39;t like them, taking their turn to kick
    the next guy down.
</blockquote>

<p>Yet throughout the chapter she finds places again and again where these men show
their true colors, as &quot;rock bottom utilitarians&quot; who judged people by their actions
and not by their words.</p>
<p>The chapter also covers topics on humor, death, and even some political leanings. 
It was really a fascinating read, and the author draws her own perceptions, 
critiquing the macho culture around her in a way only a woman could. Despite my
feelings that she had a bit of confirmation bias, her views and opinions were
often fresh and interesting. Her lense of the world of these men&#39;s men gave me a
good deal of food for thought. Perhaps the thing that kept me engrossed in 
reading was her praise of the nurturing and educational methods of the various 
men around her.</p>
<blockquote>
    They took me under their wings. Another older bowler had done this. Taking me
    aside between rounds, he tried to teach me a few things to improve my game.
    This was male mentor stuff all the way. He treated me like a son, guiding
    me with firm encouragement and solid advice, an older man lending a younger
    man his expertise.
    <br>
    This was commonplace. During the course of the bowling season, which lasted
    nine months, a lot of men from the other teams tried to give me tips on my game.
</blockquote>

<p>Mrs. Vincent finds herself in a masculine dominated area for nine months, and 
becomes friends with the members of her team. One in particular, Jim, she grows 
close to and reveals herself as a woman to him first. Opposite to her expections,
Jim and the rest of the crew aren&#39;t bothered at all. And after revealing herself
to them, they continue to be her friends and treat her just the same. Not just as 
&quot;one of the guys&quot;, but as a friend. In Norah&#39;s words:</p>
<blockquote>
    They made me look ridiculous to myself and they made me laugh about it. And
    for that I will always be grateful to them, because anybody who does that 
    for you is a true and great friend.
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, my reactions to this chapter were to be amused by each joke and story,
to feel sympathy when hearing of some of the very real and very difficult issues
each of these men face, and to feel solidarity with the author and these men I 
don&#39;t even know. There are truths echoed that you&#39;ll hear any man repeat in those
pages, to see them on page, written by a woman, was remarkable. Often I feel that 
men&#39;s issues are brushed under the rug in favor of womens, while there are plenty
of reasons one might prioritize, it was still nice to see even slight recognition
of this. Reading more of the book only further showed me just how seriously the 
author had taken her work.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re looking to see how your typical &#39;guys night&#39; is, no look further than 
this chapter, it hits on a lot of core pieces I&#39;ve seen in all male events. Though
there were some things which I&#39;ve never seen and found unsettling. And if you find
something that disturbs you during the chapter, remember that this is a small set
of men, and Mrs. Vincent specifically went out of her way to find areas of intense
stereotypical masculinity.</p>
<p><div id="chapter3"></div></p>
<h4>Strippers, Sex, and Secrets</h4>
<p>I have never been to a strip club, nor have I ever considered it something I 
wanted to do. In this chapter Norah enters the vile world of strip joints and 
attempts to analyze it. </p>
<blockquote>
    Sometimes even respectable men with respectable lives have primal ugly stuff
    bracketed somewhere in theirminds, kept in its place apart from the purported 
    love that goes with the responsibility of fatherhood and husbanding. How could 
    it be otherwise? Much as they might have liked them to, these drives and desires 
    didn&#39;t somehow cease to exist in respectable company. It was only society&#39;s 
    prevailing myth, or perhaps female wish fulfillment, that had pretended otherwise. 
    As a result, individual men and women were left to sort out the sordid reality 
    ontheir own, hurting and getting hurt because sometimes it was too hard to 
    successfully resolve the conflict between baseline male sexuality and the 
    civilized role of a man.
    <br>
    These clubs and the thoughts and feelings that produce them are the squalid 
    subbasement of male sexuality in which a lot of men have at least one foot or 
    toe firmly planted. No matter how high they ascend in the civilized world, 
    no matter how tall, how dapper, how educated or savvy they stand in the 
    stratosphere of age and accomplishment, a lot of average guys still have a 
    nudie film looping in the back of their minds. And the more educated, 
    politicized, refined they become, the more ashamed of their base proclivities 
    they often feel.
</blockquote>

<p>Mrs Vincent brings an interesting perspective to the table in the above quotes 
and throughout the chapter. Primarily focusing on the feelings of the men in the 
clubs, (or what she assumes they must feel) and honing in on the why and what it 
all means. Diving into the notions of primal instincts, understanding of base 
needs, and trying to find some facsimile of herself and her character Ned she&#39;s 
playing. </p>
<p>One thing I want to note, is her use of the word <em>purports</em> in the first paragraph. 
I don&#39;t know how many male friends Mrs Vincent has, specifically, how many friends 
she has seen transition from the role of bachelor to father. But many of my friends 
have gone through this. It changes a person greatly. For her to casually spew the 
word: <em>purports</em> in reference to the love which fathers have for their children, 
and imply that somehow it is a false one, disturbs me. To be frank, my rule of 
not looking at not how she was saying, but what she was saying, when used here 
and only on that section, causes me to pause and wonder if the author believes 
men to be some type of inhuman creature incapable of love entirely. This one issue
within a larger chapter focused on sexuality is easily ignored though, as much 
of what she says throughout is engaging and thought provoking.</p>
<blockquote>
    At some point all of this ceased to be about desire, if it was ever really 
    about desire in the firstplace, and became about something else: loneliness, 
    or inner pain, or doing time or penance for some longago hurt that had never
    healed but somehow found companionable misalliance here with all the other 
    misfits and detritus. I don&#39;t think anybody in that place was really capable 
    of normal arousal anymore. They were dead inside and you could see it. They 
    were in pain and sitting with it, looking for it, maybe even getting off to 
    it, because when pleasure is used up, painis all that&#39;s left. It&#39;s the only 
    thing that lasts longer.
</blockquote> 

<p>Her discussions about her perception of male sexuality were interesting to read, 
especially when she was reflecting on being exposed to what she called the base 
of male sexuality. While interesting, I can&#39;t help but wonder if she ever thinks 
about the way that people often seek comfort within the embrace of a stranger 
during difficult times in their lives, or the way that some people engage in 
rebound sex after a relationship as if it were therapy. But most of all, I wonder 
if she feels the same when going to a lesbian strip club, would she be able to 
make the same arguments or hold beliefs such as this then: </p>
<blockquote>
    ... emotion, seduction, imagination, mental connection -- the things that are, 
    perhaps, the hallmarks of female sexuality...
</blockquote>

<p>When confronted with a similar notion of what she calls male sexuality within a
stripper named Gina, she becomes confused. When asking why Gina is a dancer, and
being met with the reply: &quot;I love men.&quot;, doubt was the first thing that comes to 
her mind. At Gina&#39;s distaste for women and their anatomy, Mrs Vincent is shocked 
and assumes that Gina simply must have had a traumatic past that caused her<br>dislike of, in Gina&#39;s words: &quot;Wet sloppy pussy&quot;. Perhaps it is because of the authors 
orientation that she doesn&#39;t understand, or she simply enjoys secretions of mucus. 
It seems strange to me that someone would be shocked by another person&#39;s preferences 
so much. Perhaps I&#39;m simply biased because Gina echos some of my own sentiment 
towards bodily fluids and I&#39;m more inclined to agree with someone who has chosen, 
from 18-34, to dance due to their passion for something despite not needing the 
money, and not allow a societal stigma to get in the way of that.</p>
<p>However, Mrs Vincent is by no means unaware of the duel power play within the 
scenes she visited:</p>
<blockquote>
    This place wasn&#39;t just where men came to be beasts. It was also where women 
    came to exercise some vestige of sexual power in the most unvarnished way possible.
    My pussy for your dollars. I say when, I say how, I say how much and I get 
    paid for it. There was tremendous manipulation built into the rules under
    which these places operated. The provision against touching the girls could be
    bent or borken at will by each individual girl, and enforced by guys hired for 
    the purpose, guys like the pierced biker at the couch-room door. This was an 
    age-old whore-john-pimp dynamic, but more played at than truly enacted, and 
    always in a controlled setting. It was a grotesque parody of what women and 
    men did in real life, the mating dance with all the civilized pretense 
    stripped away.
</blockquote>

<p>And near the end of the chapter reflects on how no one within these environments 
is better than the other, that each individual within the clubs has a role to 
play, and that no participant was more victimized than any other, the debasement 
of the individuals was equal. Perhaps that was the saddest part about this chapter, 
perhaps it was one of the more enlightening notes to take from it. Either way, 
a chapter worth reading.</p>
<p><div id="thoughts"></div></p>
<h4>Thoughts</h4>
<p>I thought about creating a review of all the chapters in this book, many of them
are fascinating, for example, the next chapter is about love and dating as a man.
Where the author runs into the troubles and pressures of being, literally, in 
the man&#39;s shoes when trying to pick girls up at a bar. There&#39;s a chapter about 
life within an all male monesty, an all male retreat, and even a door to door 
salesman experience (I didn&#39;t even know that was still a job). </p>
<p>While I think people who believe that <em>all</em> feminists are evil man-haters might 
get turned off by some of the language or views held by the author. I also think 
that this book is a good stepping stone towards being open to listening to those
types of views, even when you don&#39;t agree with them. Norah Vincent&#39;s writing is 
approachable, and though her peanut gallery comments and side jabs at masculinity 
can be offputting, the stories themselves are a good mix of touching, emotional, 
and stressful lives. The mental strain she put herself through, ending up with 
depression after experiencing what it&#39;s like to be under the day to day pressures 
of manhood, is a testament to just how serious she was in getting what she believes
to be the full masculine experience.</p>
