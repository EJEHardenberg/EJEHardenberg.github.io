    If I asked you what the 4th amendment of the constitution was, could you 
tell me without looking it up? More importantly, do you understand what 
rights are guaranteed to you by it?
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, 
and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be 
violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, 
supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place 
to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    No doubt you know you're protected from
    <em>
     unreasonable searches and 
seizures
    </em>
    , and that warrents are generally required for searches of your 
home. But are you aware that it is the 4th amendment that is invoked in 
defending your right not to be spied on?
    <a href="http://www.brandeis.edu/legacyfund/bio.html">
     Justice Louis D. Brandeis
    </a>
    sums up the 4th amendment well as
    <em>
     “the right to be let alone”
    </em>
    . And 
this right is a cornerstone that supports the 1st amendment's right of 
free speech. Unfortunately, privacy is often the lamb on the alter of 
national security.

    While the United States lauds itself as
    <em>
     The Land of the Free
    </em>
    , the 
continued violations of the rights of its citizens is disturbingly 
prevalent on even a cursory glance through its history. From the 17,000
    <a href="http://library.truman.edu/microforms/martin_luther_king.asp">
     pages of material the FBI kept on Martin Luther King Jr
    </a>

     millions of american's telephone calls by the NSA
    </a>
    , not a 
single decade passes without an Orwellian nightmare taking place. The 
worst part of this continued bleeding of the 4th amendment is that many 
watch it take place, but do nothing. There is no guide in place which 
chronicles a list of such wounds, but taking stock of a few paints a 
grim picture of the patient.
   </p>
   <p>
    In January 18th 2016s New England edition of the New York Times, an 
article titled
    <em>
     <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/18/business/media/disruption-by-netflix-irks-tv-foes.html">
      Disruption By Netflix Irks TV Foes
     </a>
    </em>
    ran. While the 
piece itself is only reporting on Network Television's begging of 
Netflix to release ratings, an interestint paragraph caught my eye when 
I was reading it:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The battle over ratings began when Alan Wurtzel, NBC Universal’s head 
of research, said on Wednesday that he was confronting the 
“800-pound gorilla” and gave the news media what he described as a 
“Netflix reality check.”
Ratings, particularly among 18- to 49-year-olds, dictate how much money 
cable and broadcast networks make from advertisers.
Mr. Wurtzel provided data from a firm named Symphony Advanced Media,
     <strong>
      which uses audio content recognition installed on phones to recognize 
what is being watched and when
     </strong>
     . According to Symphony’s data, the 
Netflix show “Jessica Jones” was viewed by 4.8 million people within 
the first 35 days of its premiere in the 18- to 49-year-old bracket 
important to advertisers. In that demographic, Mr. Wurtzel said that, 
according to Symphony’s data, “Master of None” had 3.9 million viewers, 
“Narcos” had 3.2 million and Amazon’s “The Man in the High Castle” had 
2.1 million viewers.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <center>
    <small>
     (Emphasis mine)
    </small>
   </center>
   <p>
    While Wurtzel may want to give Netflix a “reality check.” I'd prefer to 
look into what
    <a href="http://www.symphonyam.com/results/">
     Symphony Advanced Media
    </a>
    is and does. According to their 
website, their product
    <strong>
     passively collects behavior patterns cross 
media and in real time
    </strong>
    . Their results page boasts about user's 
twitter usage in relation to their television viewing. No matter how 
anonymous the data they collect from you is, it is an admitted fact that 
this company is actively monitoring what you are doing, in your home, 
and using it to provide information to advertisers on how best to sell 
you something. At what point does listening in on what you watch, and on 
what you do while you're watching cross the line for the average 
citizen? Does a private company doing such things violate your rights? 
What about the rights of another company? If
    <a href="https://twitter.com/privacy">
     Twitter's privacy policy
    </a>
    states that they do not disclose your private personal information, and 
they only share information with their own 3rd party services. Then where 
does Symphony's monitoring of your phone fall in legaly?
   </p>
   <p>
    Putting aside inter-company legality, the sheer scope of advertisement's 
disgusting crusade for behavioral analysis is insane. Buy you might say 
that this is just paranoia. After all the goal, as with NBC and Symphony, 
is to make money. And there's no harm in some research to sell you 
something right? In a long article about the lengths companies go to to 
figure out how to sell you things, a curious thing happened.
    <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/magazine/shopping-habits.html">
     Target knew a man's daughter was pregnant before he did
    </a>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     About a year after Pole created his pregnancy-prediction model, a man walked into a Target outside Minneapolis and demanded to see the manager. He was clutching coupons that had been sent to his daughter, and he was angry, according to an employee who participated in the conversation.
     <br/>
     “My daughter got this in the mail!” he said. “She’s still in high school, and you’re sending her coupons for baby clothes and cribs? Are you trying to encourage her to get pregnant?”
     <br/>
     The manager didn’t have any idea what the man was talking about. He looked at the mailer. Sure enough, it was addressed to the man’s daughter and contained advertisements for maternity clothing, nursery furniture and pictures of smiling infants. The manager apologized and then called a few days later to apologize again.
     <br/>
     On the phone, though, the father was somewhat abashed. “I had a talk with my daughter,” he said. “It turns out there’s been some activities in my house I haven’t been completely aware of. She’s due in August. I owe you an apology.”
     <br/>
     When I approached Target to discuss Pole’s work, its representatives declined to speak with me.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    If the daughter did not want her father to know about her pregnancy, 
regardless of whether you personally see it as right or wrong, she does 
have a constitional right to do so. In their scheming for riches and 
analyzing of data points, the researchers at target forgot one simple 
thing.
    <em>
     Humans are not just numbers in a machine
    </em>
    . To treat them as such 
and to create targeted advertisements towards their demographics not 
only dehumanizes them, but converts their worth as a person into nothing 
more than a possible addition to a company's bottom line. While this 
may not be the intention of researchers such as Andrew Pole, it is the 
undeniably effect. And this is not a singular incident.
   </p>

    <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/culture/2014/04/29/3432050/can-you-hide-from-big-data/">
     Trying to hide your pregnancy from data collection is nearly impossible
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="http://janet.vertesi.com/news/can-you-opt-out-big-data">
     Janet Vertesi tried
    </a>
    , and did fairly well. But she found it extremely 
difficult, and had to actively police her family to not spill the beans. 
She had to use
    <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">
     tor
    </a>
    to browse baby-related sites, and go through a 
ridiculous number of hoops to just buy things on amazon for her upcoming 
child. While this was a self-imposed experiment, perhaps one of the most 
important point she makes is
    <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/04/26/big-data-pregnancy/#HGPFUsxJiaqj">
     in her talk
    </a>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Those kinds of activities, when you take them in the aggregate ... 
are exactly the kinds of things that tag you as likely engaging in 
criminal activity, as opposed to just having a baby,"
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    The presumption of innocence is the backbone of the judiciary system. 
While fraud detection is a useful thing, too much of a good thing is 
well known to be unhealthy. In the same way that Vertesi's actions make 
her appear like a criminal, it is the unfortunate reality that there 
are systems being tested which use everything they can get about you to 
determine your “threat score”.
    <a href="https://archive.is/ylfWy">
     Sadly, I'm not making this up
    </a>
    :
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     As officers respond to calls, Beware automatically runs the address. 
The searches return the names of residents and scans them against a 
range of publicly available data to
     <strong>
      generate a color-coded threat level 
for each person or address
     </strong>
     : green, yellow or red.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And this is only a single program among others that attempts to 
determine what class of citizen you fall into. There are plenty more:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     The cameras were only one tool at the ready. Officers could trawl a 
private database that has recorded
     <strong>
      more than 2 billion scans of vehicle 
licenses plates and locations
     </strong>
     nationwide. If gunshots were fired, a 
system called ShotSpotter could triangulate the location using 
microphones strung around the city. Another program, called Media Sonar, 
crawled social media looking for illicit activity.
     <strong>
      Police used it to 
monitor individuals
     </strong>
     , threats to schools and hashtags related to gangs.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    And the scan can be ran on any one, at any time, and the results can be 
affected by things that you never did:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     Councilman Clinton J. Olivier, a libertarian-leaning Republican, said 
Beware was like something out of a dystopian science fiction novel and 
asked Dyer a simple question: “Could you run my threat level now?”
     <br/>
     Dyer agreed. The scan returned Olivier as a green, but his home came 
back as a yellow,
     <strong>
      possibly because of someone who previously lived at 
his address
     </strong>
     , a police official said.
     <br/>
     “Even though it’s not me that’s the yellow guy, your officers are going 
to treat whoever comes out of that house in his boxer shorts as the 
yellow guy,” Olivier said. “That may not be fair to me.”
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    While it's great that equality of treatment in surveillance is alive and 
good. It really doesn't help anyone that this gross violation of rights 
is taking place. And as Olivier said, it really does sound like 
something out of a dystopian novel. But at this point, you may be 
wondering why I'm talking about both government programs that violate 
the 4th &amp; 5th amendments and advertisements?
   </p>
   <p>
    It's simple,
    <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/08/technology-executives-white-house-isis-terrorism-meeting-silicon-valley-facebook-apple-twitter-microsoft">
     the Government wants to combine with tech to increase surveillance
    </a>
    .
Why? As I stated before, National Security is the chopping block on which 
rights are maimed. The worst part is that not is it encouraged to have 
the police monitor your threat level, but also your friends:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     One area of discussion was over how a system used by Facebook to deal 
with users at risk of suicide could serve as a model for identifying 
terrorist sympathizers.
     <br/>
     The social network’s chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, walked 
government officials through how Facebook currently
     <strong>
      enables users to 
flag people
     </strong>
     who appear to be posting suicidal thoughts, a person 
familiar with the conversation said.
     <strong>
      The government officials in the 
room wondered if such a system could be used to flag terrorist content 
or detect a user who appears to be radicalizing
     </strong>
     , added the person, 
declining to be quoted on the record.
    </p>
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    The road to hell is paved by good intentions, and enabling users to flag 
each other as
    <em>
     bad citizens
    </em>
    is a terrible idea. This gamification of 
conformity is extremely similar to something China has started doing. 
While it may not be your

    </a>
    it's still a bad idea. If you don't understand why, it may help to 
understand how propaganda games effect citizens:

    In the book 1984, children are taught from a young age to rat out their 
parents if they have any instances of

experiment

    students easily fell into lockstep to 
garner favor with an authoritatian leader. If you don't understand the 
very short step from flagging possible terrorists, to flagging people 
who don't obey, to the loss of civil rights for dissidents who oppose an 
injust system, then you need to read a book about the National Socialist 
party in Germany during World War Two and leading up to it, and then also 
watch The Wave to understand how the same thing can happen in the US:

    Monitoring social media to determine if someone is going to commit a 
crime is an idea taken directly from Minority Report, or the anime Pyscho 
Pass. And just as in those works, it is a terrible idea.
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     “It’s a very fine line to get that information,” said Andre McGregor, 
a former FBI terrorism investigator and now director of security at 
Tanium Inc, a Silicon Valley security company. “You’re essentially 
trying to
     <strong>
      take what is in someone’s head and determine whether or not 
there’s going to be some violent physical reaction associated with it.”

   <p>
    To throw away the presumption of innocence and use prediction models will 
not lead to a safer state, it will lead to one who's judiciary system 
has lost it's back bone and that can no longer guarantee the freedom it 
purports to protect. These systems do one thing, throw the baby out with 
the bathwater:
   </p>
   <blockquote>
    <p>
     America’s most senior spy, director of national intelligence James Clapper.
     <br/>
     “We are interested in exploring all options with you for how to deal 
with the growing threat of terrorists and other malicious actors using technology, including encrypted technology,” the briefing document said.
     <strong>
      “Are there technologies that could make it harder
     </strong>
     for terrorists
     <strong>
      to use the internet to mobilize, facilitate, and operationalize?”
     </strong>
     <br/>

   <p>
    <em>
     Who
    </em>
    decides what groups should be shut down?
    <em>
     Who
    </em>
    decides which people 
are considered terrorists? If an activist group wishes to protest, fully 
within their 1st amendment rights, then at what point does the government 
decide to “make it harder … to mobilize, facilitate, and operationalize”? 
If a group wished to denounce or protest a war would you really want the 
power to silence them being put into the hands of those who they are 
criticizing?

    The United States of America was born out of a war for freedom from 
Great Britain. If not for the ability to anonymously publish the 
pamphlet
    <em>
     <a href="http://hua.umf.maine.edu/Reading_Revolutions/Paine.html">
      Common Sense
     </a>
    </em>
    the country may not exist today. Such a 
pamphlet, if neccesary today, would be hard pressed to be published 
without leaving a trace to sellers, advertisers, or other big data 
agencies, and by extension, the government which it might be written 
against. Bleeding the 4th amendment dry, does nothing but weaken the 
rights of the people, and therefore the nation. That it is done under 
the pretense of protecting the country is hypocrisy of the highest 
order. Perhaps the simplest rational for why the 4th amendment is 
important was said by Edward Snowden:
