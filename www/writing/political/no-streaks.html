			<h2><a href="disclaimer">Disclaimer</a></h2>
			<h3>On Github removing Streaks from their UI</h3><p>My github streak was over 670 days. My goal was to get to two years, and
it was a really great motivation to look into new software, try things
out, and give back to the open source community where I can. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I will never see my streak get to two years, because
<a href="https://github.com/blog/2173-more-contributions-on-your-profile">github removed the feature</a>. This doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not going to
continue trying to do something everyday, and it doesn&#39;t mean I&#39;m not
going to contribute to open source. But I doubt I&#39;ll be as motivated as
I was when I saw that number climbing each day. The motivation, that if
I didn&#39;t do a little something today, that all my effort, all those 600+
days before, would be thrown away, was astounding in its motivation. </p>
<p>I traveled outside the country within the course of my streak, I flew to
conferences, and traveled to visit family, and I went to funerals and
weddings. Despite that, every day I commited. Now that the feature is
gone, now what? </p>
<p>It&#39;s not all bad, the new feature talked about in github&#39;s blog post
that allows private contributions to appear as anonymized contributions
in the &quot;green square chart&quot; is really nice. I can&#39;t count the number of
times after a day at work that I wished all the work I did counted
towards my streak. And I suppose now it does, in a way. But I&#39;m lacking
that number, and that number was <em>the</em> reason for me to try to better
myself code-wise everyday. </p>
<p>Honestly, I wish they had added the private contributions feature and
kept the streaks number. And I would really like to know what their
justification for removing the feature is. </p>
<p><em>Update:</em>
I was reading <a href="https://archive.is/tHNIt">some discussion on ycombinator</a> and was unsurprised to
see a lot of other people using the feature in the same way I was, as a
personal motivator. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t find any well sourced
justifications for the change itself, so maybe if everyone complains
enough github will actually listen to its users.</p>
