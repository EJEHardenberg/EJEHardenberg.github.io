			<h3>On Protesting</h3>
<h4>No Voice is Too Small</h4>
<p>Something that many people seem to think is that for a protest to be
effective you need to have a lot of people; while that&#39;s a given that
larger numbers creates a larger stirring of the proverbial pot, you can
accomplish plenty when you have the right influence. </p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://vtdigger.org/2014/04/03/tentative-agreement-ccta-drivers-back-road-friday/">when bus drivers went on strike</a> in vermont they were only
a few individuals, but their affect was massive. Or when <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2014/02/15/1277714/-Divestment-protest-and-human-oil-spill-at-Pitzer-College-2-14-14">students at
Pomona College</a> struck out about divesting from fossil fuels. The club
organizing the protests was rather small, but they still organized and
had a large impact on the college. </p>
<p>So while some groups <a href="https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&amp;q=%23RealNetNeutrality">within the #RealNetNeutrality</a> campaign may be
small, they&#39;re part of an international campaign. And it is this
solidarity that is a driving force that will (I hope) have an impact on
the FCC&#39;s direction on their Net Neutrality rulings. </p>
<p>For anyone who doesn&#39;t know what Net Neutrality is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpbOEoRrHyU">John Oliver</a> sums
up things in a hilarious way, and focuses on what the affect of the
rulings would be. It&#39;s worth a watch, and I imagine you&#39;ll be in stiches
by the end of it and also, hopefully, scared. </p>
<h4>A successful protest inspires change</h4>
<p>Because <em>that</em> is what a protest is really an attempt to do. A protest
is an attempt to bring about a change, it&#39;s an attempt, as it were to,
<a href="http://johnpilger.com/articles/power-illusion-and-americas-last-taboo">Win Hearts And Minds</a>. This can be through an appeal to someone&#39;s moral
values or good nature, but really, fear is a better motivater. A protest
says: &quot;If you don&#39;t do something now, about this issue I&#39;m showing you,
there will be consequences that will affect you&quot;. </p>
<p>There <em>are</em> nonviolent protests, or simple protests of people sitting
down. But even when these happen, if you talk to the protester&#39;s you&#39;re
likely going to hear about whatever is causing them to protest, and the
intent is to inform you, and hopefully get you to protest as well
because you believe in the message. And because <em>you are afraid of what
will happen if you don&#39;t</em>. Nonviolent protests typically don&#39;t gain a
lot of news coverage since watching someone sit somewhere for a long
time isn&#39;t particularly interesting to most. </p>
<h4>Importance of a Goal</h4>
<p>From what I can tell, most protests are around a single core issue. This
seems wise. While they&#39;re many many issues in the world, trying to address
all of them at once is a naive and foolhardy approach. However when
there is a single, simple demand, it is <em>much</em> easier to fight back
against a system.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_suffrage_in_the_United_States">Women&#39;s Suffrage</a> took over nearly a century, but it was a
nonviolent protest, using hunger strikes and picketing as one of its
many methods of inspiring change. In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_March">India</a>, Mahatma Gandhi rejected
British taxes and products and became renown around the world. During
World War II <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Rose">The White Rose</a> distributed leaflet&#39;s protesting the
German Nationalist Party&#39;s control of the government. </p>
<p>Each of these movements had one simple goal. Voting rights, a stance
against imperialism, and a call to action against tyrany. All of these
happened in the last century. </p>
<p>Recently, I took part in a small protest within my own town for Net
Neutrality. It was small, but still part of the <a href="https://www.battleforthenet.com/#protest">international event</a>
and will hopefully bare fruit soon. After speaking to a few people, most
feel that protests don&#39;t change much. And I think that that attitude
comes from their view on American Society. Primarily, that the news
media often doesn&#39;t report on peaceful protests or other events that
don&#39;t generate a lot of buzz. </p>
<p>It&#39;s a shame. </p>
