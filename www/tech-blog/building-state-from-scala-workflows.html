    Building Content State from Workflow and Audit Logs
   </h3>
   <h4>
    Background
   </h4>
   <p>
    For a little while I've been milling over the idea that the state of an object 
is a result of the history it's been through. For example, you could say that 
a blog post is the result of multiple iterations of thought, writing, and 
revising. In order to create something like that, you have a single piece 
of content having actions applied to it, and this ultimately changes its 
state. So you think of the following
    <em>
     actions
    </em>
    that go into making a blog 
post:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Have idea for blog post
    </li>
    <li>
     Write down thoughts
    </li>
    <li>
     Edit and correct typos
    </li>
    <li>
     Read again and look for improvements
    </li>
    <li>
     Improve with more links, references and better wording
    </li>
    <li>
     Publish blog post
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    This sequence of events could be captured by a few states:
   </p>
   <table>
    <thead>
     <th>
      State
     </th>
     <th>
      Description
     </th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Start State
      </td>
      <td>
       Nothing is done yet
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Brainstorming Phase
      </td>
      <td>
       Coming up with an idea for a post
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Writing
      </td>
      <td>
       The post is being written
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Editorial
      </td>
      <td>
       The post is being reviewed and suggestions made for improving
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Published
      </td>
      <td>
       The blog post is done being improved and is out for reading
      </td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
   <p>
    We always have a start state or some kind as a starting point that says 
that nothing has been done yet for whatever content is being created. Then 
we move between three main phases: thinking, writing, and reviewing. For 
a one person team there isn't really a well-defined progression here, but 
for a team working on a single product there might be very well defined 
roles for each member. A producer might do most of the brain storming, 
then pass along their notes to a writer during a meeting. Once the writer 
has a rough draft, they'll send it to an editorial team. At this point 
we might loop back saying there needs to be more done before it's ready, 
which could end up back in either the producer or the writer's court. 
Either way, it will go through the same set of actions over and over until 
it finally reaches the published state:
   </p>
   <table>
    <thead>
     <th>
      Action
     </th>
     <th>
      Description
     </th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Brainstorming
      </td>
      <td>
       Coming up with an idea for a post
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Start Writing
      </td>
      <td>
       Someone will start writing
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Start Editing
      </td>
      <td>
       Someone will start editing
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Submit Corrections
      </td>
      <td>
       Send piece back to writer or producer for more work
      </td>
     </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>
       Publish
      </td>
      <td>
       The blog post is put out for reading
      </td>
     </tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
   <p>
    As we write out the state's and action's that can be applied to something 
it is notable that you can begin to see a
    <em>
     workflow
    </em>
    emerge from this. 
This leads us to believe that a workflow is the set of actions and states 
in which content can transition through before it is published. Or generally 
speaking, before an object has reached an end state with no further actions.
   </p>
   <p>
    Now let's say that you're not just writing one blog post. But a bunch of 
them, and your team isn't able to always walk over to each other to check 
how something is going. At that point, you'll probably end up with something 
in place to keep track of these things. Maybe basecamp, maybe Jira, maybe 
something like Salesforce. No matter what you get, you're now in the business 
of keeping track of not just the content, but what its current state is 
and where it's supposed to go next. Depending on what you use, you might 
have a history of events that happened, or you might just have a whole 
bunch of notes attached to a single object. So long as the management of
the content can tell you where to send it next, or why someone added a 
long essay about some unrelated topic, you're good!
   </p>
   <h4>
    Codifying State
   </h4>
   <p>
    The idea of State is pretty easy to put into code, after all it's just a 
label right? One thing that helps to know in a workflow is
    <em>
     when
    </em>
    you 
can move into a new state. After all, we don't move directly from 
brainstorming to published! So the idea of a state also includes the idea 
of a
    <em>
     prerequisite
    </em>
    . That one state must come before another. The 
enforcement of this idea is entirely up to the implementation though. 
For reason's you'll see soon, we'll just leave our model of state simple:
   </p>
   <pre><code>case class State(name: String)
</code></pre>
   <h4>
    Codifying Action and Workflow
   </h4>
   <p>
    Action is a little more complicated but not by much. An action allows an 
object to transition from one state to another, so we'll need a
    <code>
     from
    </code>
    and a
    <code>
     to
    </code>
    field of some kind. On top of that, if we consider actions to 
be the
    <em>
     links
    </em>
    in a directed graph, then they also possess a
    <code>
     direction
    </code>
    . 
For UI purposes, and for our own sanity, we'll also want to include some 
human readable information like a
    <code>
     name
    </code>
    within the model so we can make 
sense of any output we're debugging or that we need to show to a user.
   </p>
   <pre><code>sealed trait Direction
case object Forward extends Direction
case object Backward extends Direction

case class Action(from: State, to: State, flow: Direction, name: String)
</code></pre>
   <p>
    Using a
    <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/old/node/6568">
     sealed trait
    </a>
    we can ensure that the compiler will know when 
we've created an exhaustive match against classes of type
    <code>
     Direction
    </code>
    . 
And we can rest assured that the "direction" of an action will be 
represented correctly. Now that we have both
    <code>
     State
    </code>
    s and
    <code>
     Action
    </code>
    s we 
can consider how to model something like the following:
   </p>
   <p>
    <img src="/images/tech-blog/workflow-1.png" style="max-width:100%"/>
   </p>
   <p>
    This sums up the scenario we were discussing earlier. In code we might 
create a list of State's like so:
   </p>
   <pre><code>val start = State("Start")
val brainstorming = State("brainstorming")
val writing = State("writing")
val editorial = State("editorial")
val approved = State("approved")
val published = State("published")
</code></pre>
   <p>
    and a set of actions:
   </p>
   <pre><code>val startBrainstorming = Action(start, brainstorming, Forward, "start brainstorming")
val startWriting = Action(brainstorming, writing, Forward, "start writing")
val getMoreInfo = Action(writing, brainstorming, Backward, "get more information from producer")
val sendToEditor = Action(writing, editorial, Forward, "submit for editing")
val sendBackToWriter = Action(editorial, writing, Backward, "send back to writer")
val backToDrawingBoard = Action(editorial, brainstorming, Backward, "back to the drawing board")
val approvePost = Action(editorial, approved, Forward, "approve post")
val publishPost = Action(approved, published, Forward, "publish post")
</code></pre>
   <p>
    These would become characteristic of our own workflow:
   </p>
   <pre><code>case class Workflow(states: List[State], actions: List[Action])
</code></pre>
   <h4>
    Tracking content
   </h4>
   <p>
    So now that we have our definition of Workflow as a collection of states 
and actions, we can move onto how to actually keep track of what state 
something is in! Essentially, all we need to do is keep track of the actions
themselves, allong with any notes about the transition. A
    <em>
     log entry
    </em>
    than 
is something like the following:
   </p>
   <pre><code>case class LogEntry(startState: State, endState: State, note: String, flowTaken: Direction, actionTaken: Action)
</code></pre>
   <p>
    once we have a list like this, taken
    <em>
     in sequential order
    </em>
    , we can come 
up with an algorithm to determine an end state. The algorithm isn't that 
hard if we have a single chain of events, after all, the last one in the 
sequence is the last state we were in.
   </p>
   <pre><code>val log: Seq[LogEntry] = ...
log.last
</code></pre>
   <p>
    But what if your workflow is more complicated and doesn't simply end in an
published state, but also has multiple approval processes and conditions 
that need to be satisfied before it's ready? In that case, our log, even 
when ordered, will not be as simple as a
    <code>
     log.last
    </code>
    line of code. Rather, 
we'll need to keep track of each "path" through the log to some extent. 
Or at least be able to connect entries together and build up a history 
of events for each "path".
   </p>
   <p>
    This isn't too hard considering each
    <code>
     LogEntry
    </code>
    has both a start and an end 
state. We simply need to compare Entry's against the previous and track 
all of the last states. This can be done easily with a list of stacks. A 
stack is the perfect choice for this since a
    <em>
     first in, last out
    </em>
    strategy 
will allow us to push down as many states as we need, but also get an 
answer to what the last state is quickly. A list of stack's allows us to 
maintain multiple "paths" in the log by comparing the start state of the 
current state to the end state of each element on the top of the stack. 
Once the top is figure'd out, we simply push down the element and continue 
on from there, the only limitation is that it's first come first serve
for which stack the new entry will be added to should two stacks have 
the same end state that matches the new state's beginning.
   </p>
   <pre><code>def determineCurrentState(log: Seq[LogEntry], workflow: Workflow): Set[State] = {
    var sequences = List[Stack[LogEntry]](
        Stack[LogEntry]()
    )
    if (log.isEmpty) {
        Set[State]()
    } else {
        for (entry &lt;- log) {
            var pushed = false
            entry.flowTaken match {
                case Forward =&gt;
                    sequences.map { stack =&gt;
                        if (stack.isEmpty ||
                            stack.headOption.map(_.endState) == Some(entry.startState)) {
                            stack.push(entry)
                            pushed = true
                        }
                    }
                    if (!pushed) {
                        val newStack = Stack[LogEntry](entry)
                        sequences = sequences :+ newStack
                    }
                case Backward =&gt;
                    sequences.map { stack =&gt;
                        stack.headOption.map { topEntry =&gt;
                            if (topEntry.endState == entry.startState &amp;&amp; !pushed) {
                                stack.push(entry)
                                pushed = true
                            }
                        }
                    }
            }
        }
    }
    sequences.map(_.headOption).filter(_.isDefined).map(_.get.endState).toSet
}
</code></pre>
   <p>
    The input to the above function is an ordered list, probably pulled from a 
database somewhere ordered by timestamp or some type of sequencing number. 
The workflow is passed as a parameter because we could add checks against 
the workflow to verify that all the state's we're pushing down onto the stacks 
are allowed to be in that order; but for simplicity the above code doesn't do 
that. If it did, it'd replace
   </p>
   <pre><code>stack.headOption.map(_.endState) == Some(entry.startState))
</code></pre>
   <p>
    with something like:
   </p>
   <pre><code>transitionPermissibleByWorkflow(stach.headOption, entry.startState)
</code></pre>
   <p>
    where the flow, start, and end state would all be checked by a helper 
function.
   </p>
   <p>
    Once we have the above algorithm we can retrieve a set of States back in 
a set. This tells us
    <em>
     all
    </em>
    of the current states for an item and allows 
us to handle content that has multiple end states. To prove that the code 
works to yourself, you can checkout the
    <a href="https://github.com/EdgeCaseBerg/scala-workflow/blob/master/src/test/scala/com.github.edgecaseberg/workflow/WorkflowTest.scala">
     repositories tests here
    </a>
    . Of 
course, knowing a State is handy, but this doesn't tell a user much. After 
all, someone keeping tabs on an item wants to not only know the state, but 
also
    <em>
     what actions can be taken
    </em>
    . This is simple:
   </p>
   <pre><code>def possibleActionsForState(state: State, workflow: Workflow): List[Action] = {
    workflow.actions.filter(_.from == state)
}
</code></pre>
   <p>
    And if we combine this with our other function:
   </p>
   <pre><code>def possibleActionsForLog(log: Seq[LogEntry], workflow: Workflow): Map[State, List[Action]] = {
    determineCurrentState(log, workflow).map(state =&gt; state -&gt; possibleActionsForState(state, workflow)).toMap
}
</code></pre>
   <p>
    we can now retrieve which actions an item can have performed given a workflow 
and a log file!
   </p>
   <h4>
    What next?
   </h4>
   <p>
    The next thing to do would be to create some type of simple system or API that 
allowed this general model to work with your own content. A few ideas pop up to 
me:
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>
     Allow input of a workflow via
     <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOT_(graph_description_language)">
      dotfiles
     </a>
     or a simplification of
    </li>
    <li>
     Concept of major and minor states, so that the branching that results in multiple 
end states for a piece of content could be controlled better (branching allowed while
in transition from a major to another major).
    </li>
    <li>
     Build a friendly UI to do all the hard work for you! (Building workflows, 
moving items along, etc).
    </li>
   </ol>
   <p>
    I know there are systems out there like
    <a href="http://java-source.net/open-source/workflow-engines">
     jBPM, Enhydra, and many more
    </a>
    but this 
is mostly a thought exercise to get the juices flowing. If you implement any 
workflow structures using this as a base, I want to know! Not just that the code 
was useful, but also where you had to make updates or changes and why. Happy 
coding!
   </p>
