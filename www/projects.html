			<h2>In my spare time</h2>
<p>
	For many people, they do one thing at work and have a hobby or three at home
	that they pursue. For me, programming is both my work and my hobby. 
</p>
<p>
	I have always loved programming, and when I firsted created my website 
	~5 years ago I created a small 
	list of the projects I was working on. Since then, I have always tried to 
	have at least one or two projects going on; they are cataloged below.

			WordPress2Harp

			</span>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				GreenServ is a custom JSON only, API server written in C to provide a backend to the Green Up VT project. Created to replace the python Google App Engine version of the API, it was coded to spec (with some minor enhancements) and <a href="https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/GreenUp/blob/master/api/cannon.sh">under stress testing</a> performing much better than the instances of the App Engine

			TimeCatcher

				Fall 2013
			</span>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				TimeCatcher is a time logging utility which doesn't eat your CPU cycles. Most logging software runs in the background spinning the clock away to keep track of your progress. TimeCatcher works on a simple start and stop system managed through the command line in order to not do that. Memory leak free and supporting command completion through bash shells, time catcher is a simple to use and good time logging program.

			Xemark
			<span>
				Summer 2013
			</span>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Xemark is a simple markdown language designed to be translated into html by a parser following it's BNF grammar. The parser was used as a component in generating this webpage. A bash script made did the rest of the work. Xemark functions like a CGI script in that it's input is translated from one format to an output in another (in this case xemark markdown to html). Becuase of this property it is easy to use xemark within a http server context to serve .xe files up as html to users.

			</span>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				An application to assist with <a href="http://www.greenupvermont.org/">GreenUp Vermont</a> and help to coordinate volunteers. Developed as part of the national <a href="http://www.hackforchange.org">Civic day of hacking</a> challenge by <a href="http://www.codeforbtv.org">Code for BTV</a>. The application was hastily made in php during the event. Then heaviy refactored into a RESTful API with mobile,ios and android client interfaces (Still in progress). My main contribution was the specification, design, and implementation of the REST api backend done in python. Also primarily responsible for task delegation and repository contribution maintenance.

			<p>
				A team app created for the Hack VT competition in Winooski, VT. The app listed ingredients using a recipe API and then our app displayed farms where those ingredients could be found. Weather data for the last year was integrated into the colouring of the markers of the farm to show how much precipitation had fallen, to render a crude quality estimate of the crops. Once ingredients were selected, a user could select dishes to get recipes using the ingredients they had selected

			Approaches to Solving Infinite Q-Learning Oscillations in a Grid World
			<span>
				Spring 2012
			</span>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				My term project for CS295 Machine Learning, using Matlab I implemented Watson's Q-Learning Algorithm and applied it to a simulated Grid World. Upon discovering an issue involving circular logic as a result of the algorithm, I implemented 4 new approaches which resulted in a drastic improvement in performance in trail simulations. The next year, the professor asked to use my paper/project as an example of what his students should strive for.
