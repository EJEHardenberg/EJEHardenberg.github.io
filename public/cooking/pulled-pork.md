**Difficulty: Medium**

Pulled pork is probably one of the best things, ever, once you've made it you 
can put it on sandwichs, omelets, salads, anything and everything can use a nice 
dash of the wonderful meat. 

I've always shot from the hip on my slow cooker recipes, and here's one that I'm 
particularly proud of. So grab your slow cooker and cook!

**Ingredients: **

- Pork Shoulder (bone in or out, up to you)
- Seasoning (cumin, cinnamin, chili, mustard powder, salt, pepper)
- 4 Cloves of Garlic or so (if you like garlic add more!)
- 1/2 green pepper
- 1 small/medium sized red onion
- cup of chicken broth 

**Instructions: **

- Chop the green pepper and onion into small pieces
- Slice and dice the garlic
- Pour the chicken broth into your slow cooker and add the vegi's
- mix the seasonings into a bowl, to taste! I tend to have more cinnamin and cumin than other ingredients
- Pat the pork down with paper towels to remove extra moisture and then dry rub the spices on 
- Place into a slow cooker on low for 8-10 hours, I prefer to do the full 10
- Once cooked, drain the broth into a container but leave a few tablespoons behind
- At this point you can start mincing and pulling the pork apart with a set of forks
- Once you've extracted any bones go ahead and add BBQ sauce if desired and mix thoroughly
- Serve!
