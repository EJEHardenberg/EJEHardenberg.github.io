** Difficulty: Medium ** 

A pretty simply meal to make despite sounding so fancy. Pork tenderloin
is absolutely delicious and a great meat to work with. You can marinate
it, you can spice it, fry, bake, or do whatever you'd like with it and
chances are, it will turn out great. 

This recipe is one I made up on the fly on a rainy day, and hm hm hmmm
it's good. All you need is pork, a vegetable, and pasta. 

** Ingredients: ** 

- Pork Tenderloin
- A dark beer with good taste (think german or local breweries)
- Pasta (I used cheese tortellini)
- A vegetable (Zuchini for me) 
- Tablespoon of olive oil
- Salt & Pepper

** Directions: ** 

- Boil a pot of water for the noodles, timing wise it's good to get the
  noodles into the pot before you start in on the pork depending on how
  you like your noodles cooked.
- Put a pan on medium high heat and heat up the olive oil
- Slice your tenderloin into 1inch thick cuts and season with salt &
  pepper
- Pour your noodles into the boiling water
- Place the pork and vegetable into your pan and cook for 5 minutes,
  turning things over once in the middle
- Remove the vegetable and lower the temperature to low
- Pour a bit of beer (just enough to cover the bottom of the pan) into
  the pan and cover. Let that simmer for 10 minutes. 
- Plate your noodles, vegetable, and meat
- you can thicken the leftover juices with corn starch or something
  similar, or just pour the juices over your food now. I choose the
  second option. The natural juices of the meat combined with the
  richness of the beer makes for a great sauce.
- EAT!
