**Difficulty: Easy**

Really easy, but tasty dinner for one or two. 

**Ingredients:**
			
- 1 Tomato
- Spices or Herbs
- Pasta
- Some lettuce (mescula)
- Cheese

**Directions:**

- Boil water on a stove and bring a pan to medium low heat
- Slice the tomato into cubes and place into pan
- Throw the pasta into the boiling water 
- Add spices or herbs to the tomato as well as the lettuce
- Slice the cheese into cubes and to the tomato mix
- Let the tomato and cheese cook until the cheese is melted to your liking. The water from the tomato will help to create a sort of sauce that will keep most of the cheese from sticking to the pan
