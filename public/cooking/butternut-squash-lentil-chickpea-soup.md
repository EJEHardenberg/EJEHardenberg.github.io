### Butternut Squash Lentil and Chickpea soup 

<img src="/images/cooking/chickpea-soup.jpeg">

Canadians know where it’s at.  If you want a soup that fills you up after a long day trooping over the tundra and warms you up better than snuggling with 20 fluffy huskies, search no longer. 

_Servings_: so many.  This soup can feed an army.  I like to let it cool, set aside some for dinner/lunch, then ladle the rest into muffin tins, freeze the tins, pop the frozen soup cubes out of the tin, and then store them in ziplocs in the freezer for a rainy day (or a blizzard if you’re in Canada). 

_Time_:   25 mins preparation

20 mins minimum cooking (longer if you want the stew to be thicker - you can use a slow cooker if you have one)

**Ingredients:**

- 1 tbsp vegetable oil
- 1 tsp cumin seeds or ground cumin
- 1/4 tsp (pinch) salt
- 2 cups chopped, peeled butternut squash (about 1/2 regular squash)
- 1 onion, chopped
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1/2 tsp chili powder[\*](#notes)
- 1/2 tsp pepper
- 3 tbsp tomato paste
- 1 can lentils, drained and rinsed (or approx. 1 cup dried)
- 1 can chickpeas, drained and rinsed
- 4 cups vegetable stock
- 1 strip lemon rind (or a squirt of lemon juice - not essential)
- 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley and lemon wedges (garnish for hella fancy people who like to “plate” their food well \*cough Ethan cough\*)


**Instructions:**

1. Saute the cumin seeds in vegetable oil for a minute, or until you can smell it (if you only have ground cumin, skip this step).
2. Add squash cubes, onion, garlic, chili powder, and pepper/salt and fry, stirring occasionally until the onion is soft (approx 5 mins).  
3. Add the tomato paste and cook/stir for another minute.
4. Add lentils\*\*, chickpeas, stock, and lemon rind/juice; cover and simmer until squash is tender, about 20 mins (if you want a speedy meal.  I prefer to plan ahead and let it simmer on low for hours.  Or, if you have a slow cooker, this is the perfect recipe to whip it out for).  Once it’s cooked to your satisfaction, discard the lemon rind (if you can find it - see, this is why we use lemon juice - so much easier).  
5. For those of you who are “plating” your food, sprinkle each dish with chopped parsley and add a lemon rind.  Enjoy!

\*<small> A note for the seriously spice averse among you - this recipe was made for Canadians so, let’s face it, it’s not that spicy.  But it still has a bit of a kick, so if you’re really sensitive, you can substitute the chili powder for chili flakes, use less, or omit it all together</small>

 If you are using dried lentils, add 1 cup of lentils and 2-1/2 cups of water (in addition to the 4 cups of stock).  You might need to simmer it up to 25 mins until the lentils are cooked fully.</small>
