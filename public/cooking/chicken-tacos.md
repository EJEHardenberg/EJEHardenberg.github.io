**Directions:**

- Place Taco Shells into oven until warmed
- Heat frying pan to medium heat and saute vegetables.
- Slice chicken breasts into small slices about 1-2 inches long.
- Place sliced chicken into bowl with spices and mix until  the spices have stuck to the chicken
- Once vegetables are done, pour vegetables onto a plate for serving and drop chicken into pan.
- Cook chicken until insides are no longer pink, turning every few minutes to evenly cook the meat. 
- Removes shells from the oven and place vegetables and meat into shells. 
- Optionally, heat some salsa in a small pot and apply to taco shells.
- Eat an be merry
