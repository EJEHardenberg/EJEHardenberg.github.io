### Pan Fried Salmon

I was inspired by a cooking book I was given recently, I decided to cook up some salmon. Being a big fan of the frying pan, I figured I'd try to make it in one! I was **not** disappointed. 

The only reason this is **medium** difficulty is becuase you do need to stay with the fish and [tend to it carefully](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/06/how-to-cook-salmon-pan-fry-fish-food-lab.html)

**Difficulty: Medium**

**Ingredients:**

- 1/4 cup of soysauce
- 1 Tablespoon maple syrup
- 1 Tablespoon horseradish
- Salmon Steaks, 3/4 inch thick, marinade up to 4

**Directions**

- Mix up all the liquid ingredients, put them in a bag, and then put the steaks into the bag.
- Throw the whole thing into the fridge for an hour, flip it, than let it marinate for another. 
- Heat up a pan to high heat, you want to sear the skin quickly.
- Put a little bit of olive or vegitable oil onto the pan to help it sear the fish when you add it.
- Add the fish, skin side _down_ onto the pan, cover the pan
- Cook for a few minutes, flip it before the skin sticks to the pan, but after it's coagulated enough to form a base for the meat
- Sear the other side for another 5 or so minutes until the top is golden and crisp, at this point you can flip it again until you feel it's done. For temperatures check [here](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/06/how-to-cook-salmon-pan-fry-fish-food-lab.html)
- Serve up and enjoy!
