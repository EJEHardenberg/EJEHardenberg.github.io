### Vermont Rhubard Cake

<img src="/images/cooking/vt-rhubarb-cake.jpg">

If living in Burlington for about 6 months counts to make me a real Vermonter, Iâ€™ll take it gladly.  The first summer I lived there, I was a pretty hardcore wild rhubarb harvester (hardcore is a legitimate adjective here) and I feel like that increased my authenticity about tenfold.  Most of the rhubarb went into making this cake, which is probably one of my favorite desserts of all time.   The sort of food one wants to get stranded alone on a desert island with.  Tom Hanks style.
