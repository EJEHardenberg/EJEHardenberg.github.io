**Difficulty: Medium**

In our guest chef's own words: 

    Do you like to be happy?  Me too.  Make this bread.  Happiness awaits.

Making bread is fantastic, the whole house smells delicious you get out some butter or jam and then go to town. Toast, sandwiches, hm, everything with bread is delicious. And I love German food, so German bread? Heck yes:

**Ingredients:**

- 1/2 c. oatmeal (45 grams)
- 1/2 c. whole wheat flour (70 grams)
- 1 c. boiling water
- 1 T. honey
- 1 T. molasses (optional)
- 1 T. oil
- 1 tsp. salt
- 1/4 c. warm water
- 1/4 tsp. instant yeast
- 1 1/2 - 2 c. whole wheat flour (200 -250 grams or more)

**Directions:** 


- Mix oats and whole wheat flour in a bowl. Add the boiling water and stir. Stir in the honey, molasses, oil and salt and let cool to lukewarm (about 1/2 hour or more). It's OK if it's room temperature, too.
- To the bowl, add the 1/4 teaspoon of instant yeast, the extra water and one cup of whole wheat flour. Here, I used whole wheat white flour from King Arthur. Stir until flour is wet and dough is homogeneous...ent paper or a floured baker's peel. Slash the top of the loaf with a sharp razor blade. (I slashed in a square pattern.)
- Place the loaf in the oven on the cornmeal or flour-strewn stone and turn down to 400째F. Bake for 30-40 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 190째F.
- Note: Those hard crusts you love are created with steam. You may create steam in the oven for the first 5 minutes. Heat an old roasting pan on the rack below the stone and pour 2 cups of boiling water in it right after you put the bread in the oven.
- Spray water the sides of the oven with a squirt bottle two or three times in the first 5 minutes. Turn oven down to 400째F and bake for 30 minutes or more, until the internal temperature reaches 190째F.
- Bread steams itself dry, so let the bread cool for at least 2 hours before slicing or it may seem gummy inside.
