### Potato Carrot Soup

<img src="/images/cooking/soup/7.jpg">

Today I decided to try to make soup for the first time ever. All soup really is 
is water (or meat stock) and vegetables. So I figure'd it couldn't be too difficult 
to make. And I was right, this is a tasty, simple, and healthy soup.

** Difficulty: Medium**

** Ingredients: **

- A bundle of carrots 
- 2 Potatoes
- 1 Red Onion
- 3 Cloves of Garlic 
- Spices (Pepper, Dill, Salt)
- Milk 

** Instructions: **

- Dice up the onion and garlic cloves into small pieces
- Saute the onions and garlic in a pan with some butter or fat 
- Cut the potatoes into small cubes and the carrots into small rounds
- Place the vegetables into a pot and fill it with water just enough to cover the vegetables.
- Allow to simmer for an hour or until the potatoes are soft
- Mash the vegetables and add a bit of milk to the mixture, just enough to lighten the color
- Let it heat for a few more minutes then serve hot to any sick people in your home!
