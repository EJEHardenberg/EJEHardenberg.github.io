How to Contact me
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since I'm a lover of interesting problems, I'm always open to giving out advice 
if someone contacts me with a problem. So feel free to use the form below to 
get in touch with me. 

If you're interested in collaborating on an Open Source project that I have in
my [github repository], then fork the project and send me a pull request. If you
have a project you think I'd be a help to, then you can find my email on github
and contact me about it.

If you're interesting in employing me professionally you should reach out to me 
via the form, please include details on what type of technology you plan on using 
or already use and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.
