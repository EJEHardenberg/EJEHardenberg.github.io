Some background on me: 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

I grew up in the [90s], learning how to program in Basic from a
programming book in 7th grade. The next year I learned basic HTML and
throughout highschool took classes in Flash, Visual Basic, C++ and web
design. Besides spending time on the computer, I played flute for 9 years
and picked up other instruments like guitar, drums, and the bass along 
the way. 

 I attended the [University of Vermont] and graduated in 2013 with a 
degree in [Computer Science]. I was one class shy of an [applied math major] 
because I was busy leading two organizations (The [CS Crew] and UVM's [UPE]
chapter), working for UVM's athletic marketing department, maintaining
[VHFA]'s seven websites, and doing contract work for [Brandthropology].

 My junior year I took a graduate level evolutionary computation (EC)
 course  taught by [Maggie Eppstein] and coauthored a [paper published in GECCO]
 on the practical applications of such methods. By the end of my time at 
 University my focus was on EC methods and machine learning. My senior
 project was an application called Danger Zone. It aggregated tweets from
 twitter and used a Naive Bayes classifier to detect 'Dangerous' locations
 by tweet geotags and content. Oh, and I also made a [Wiimote Whiteboard] 
with some friends as a fun project for the [CS Crew]!

What I do now:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

After graduating I interned through a program called [Vermont HITEC] and
landed an internship at [Bear Code] working on Java 2EE and Rails
projects. I spent the summer working on the back end system for
[YouDilligence] and after a few months began designing and implementing
a system for [localvore]. Bear Code hired me after my internship was
over and I currently work as a Junior Developer there; though I also do
contract work on the side sometimes. At Bear Code I work in PHP, Java, and
any other language to get the job done, and also research and study applied
computer vision.

In my spare time, I like to work on my personal projects as well as 
contribute to Open Source ones. You can check out my [Github] for a 
repository listing of my projects or to see what I'm up to. Besides 
coding, I like to [play piano]  (I improvise and have no formal training) 
and write music. I also redo my website on a semi-annual semi-regular 
basis. You can check out some of my previous versions [here]  [and here]. 

If you want to get to know more about me, I'm typically available to chat
online in IRC on freenode or am reachable by email (listed on my github).
I hope you find this website useful, as it is a collection of [cooking],
[writing], and various other things I've done over the years
