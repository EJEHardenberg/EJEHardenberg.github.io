Things I've done
-----------------------------------------------------------------------



I've worked at a number of places, my professional experience includes
web development, server maintenance and automated backups, back end
systems with Java and Ruby on Rails, front end web site creation and
maintenance with PHP and mySQL, as well as exposure to creating Wordpress
and Drupal modules. I've used git version control at all of my jobs and 
am skilled in managing repositories and my command line fu grows daily.

My true love is C. But sadly I don't get to use it on the job much.
