Nothing is sacred but verified truth  
Of wisdom and pride this side holds no proof  
Undeniable and abstaining, the shackles lessen  
the words of many, silence of some, supressing  
Dig deeper still, let none stop you now  
these instigators, these liars, this consumer uproar  
Their revenue attritioned through justice and rage  
The voices they foolishly commanded to obey  
Turned on them now, the mouth raised to consume    
A hard lesson to learn, their lies exhumed  
From hand offering feed, their mouth bites too hard  
Too late they know now, this voice they cannot ritard.
