Thoughts are a blur, a mess  
Not even sure how I got this stress  
But I'm climbing and I'm working  
I'm lifting this chain I'm pulling  
Off my shoulders, my mind  
Taking pleasure in that grind  
It lifts me out of this hole  
I dug with myself for just no  
Reason with myself about this  
Looping thought and duress  
There's no easy answer at all  
But I'm happy to take a fall  
'cause when I climb up again  
I know it all works out in the end
