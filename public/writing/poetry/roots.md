Ever reaching and growing slow  
Climbing downward, into ground they're sown  
Raining they're nurtured and flushed out strong  
tendril spanning moments breath grows long  
With earthen bed each sprout confesses  
down under soil, bowed head, spilling transgressions  
Rooted to land and settled in for the ride  
desires elsewhere, but no one left to confide
