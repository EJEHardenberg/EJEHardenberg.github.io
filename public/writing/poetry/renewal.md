Age old and young again each year revised   
the words of the new world rhetoric of the old   
In class, in life always a student now  
yet in some ways grown too cold   
A teachers eyes bear the blow of change excised   
from what was, what is, and what systems decide  
Disrupt the process, destroy the ground  
laid before yet in the way now   
good cause to reason to bring to hope   
what will you leave behind, what groundwork?
