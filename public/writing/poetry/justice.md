The sun rises over a smouldering scene   
Rooftops gone, glass cracked, and embers gleam   
from the burnt out shack that used to be your job   
No recourse for your suffering, no comprehension of the world   
Rage out and push it out fears as big as the lies you're told   
Police marching, and the people standing against them    
"Fight the power man, stick it to the system"    
A single spark was all that was needed   
before a peaceful protest got more than heated.     
riot ready to go, step outside and emotions at high    
feed into the frenzy, of a media reporting cries   
of help and not calls for peace,  
of burning buildings and no homes asleep    
Of children gassed and reporters rubbered   
self defense is seen as offence for the troubled   
No mistake that there are people here   
despite the look in their eyes, the fear   
Anger and vitrol, no cause for the harm   
against your fellow countrymen, there is no calm   
forget your humanity and indulge in the affair  
but when you wake up, your community to repair
