Let's conspire to ignite the hope in hearts  
stoking the coals where only embers smoldered  
set faggots alight into full blown fires.  
Marshall a majority of voice and endurance  
opposing incompetent and enlightening ignorants  
What words could we give to stand up now  
What words couldn't twist our necks around  
When freedom and liberty condemn all to noose  
It isn't time to lay back, it is time to let loose.
