Inhale, Exhale.   
Feeling the kinks as air trapped flows down   
Inhale, Exhale.
Deep ballooning breath, back arched round  
Inhale, Exhale.  
Arms raised and stretched to full  
Inhale, Exhale.   
Swan diving down into relaxation's lull  
Inhale, Exhale.  
Find the correct pose, pigeon, child  
Inhale, Exhale.
Focus now, inward,finding turmoil   

Inhale.  
The feelings of air trapped within  
Pushing through each knot of stress  
A split in self, a wall raised up  
Breath can not bridge this divide   
Exhale.  
Pull air out from within the body  
mind focused clearly, air only  
Another time to dive in deep  
Another day to wake asleep  
Inhale.  
Once again this air flows in  
Filling left, filling downward  
but this air to the right doesn't bring   
peace or calmness, only emphasizes guilt   
Of what could and never could have been.   
Exhale.
