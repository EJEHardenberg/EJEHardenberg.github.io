And I  
Wish I could die  
Wish I didn't have to try  
so hard   
  
You know that I  
don't feel the same  
Don't care for the pain  
That being brings again  

And I  
No longer care  
Just cleared the air  
And I'm feeling myself again  

And I  
care not for this pain  
can't stand to feel again  
I'm ready for change  

To an I  
A nothing above  
With nothing below  
And once more I say  

I  
can't let this feeling die  
can't give up or fail to try  
but letting go again
