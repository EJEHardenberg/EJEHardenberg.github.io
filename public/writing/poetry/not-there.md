Looking out through eyes not your own  
the days pass by and by  
with each act a charade and show   
a little bit closer one dies  
inside a feeling that cannot be held  
a notion that shouldn't be felt  
desperate for a cure and not for the life  
of hardship, sadness, and health.  
What gives to you the final score  
the words kept up at night
you toss, you turn, within your bed  
no sleep, no rest, not again
