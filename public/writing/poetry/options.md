Unknown where we'll be, in a few years from now.  
Alone or with company? Should we worry now?  
A decision must be made and then our words put into action.  
Calling those who feel love and attraction:  
When the days begin to grow shorter still, where will you be?  
When moments silent and thoughts grow, flowing now the memories.  
Regret what you've done, or regret what you never did.  
But the option taken, sleep well with it.
