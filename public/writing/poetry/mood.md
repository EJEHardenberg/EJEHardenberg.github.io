Piled on and unhappily set this mood  
of apathy, morose, and happiness removed  
With each routine broken and barred from sight  
setting oneself down into the abyss each night  
Coming up from drowning in that murky sea  
Wishing for a hand held out towards me  
Only sunlight streaming across the face  
brings back the soul from nightmare's embrace
