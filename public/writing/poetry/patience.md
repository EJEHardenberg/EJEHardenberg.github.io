The familiar bold, the new reply  
A message or two, from one smile I  
move to the words and hesitate to send  
Will it be better to go over it again  
Proof-read once more and articulate thoughts  
reread the original and grin a whole lot  
Can you wait, can you compose  
yourself hurrying for the words of my prose  
Waiting and squirming will increase the pleasure  
when finally opened and treasures unmeasured  
Stiffle the laughter and send along snail  
The words I mentioned to make your smile unveil
