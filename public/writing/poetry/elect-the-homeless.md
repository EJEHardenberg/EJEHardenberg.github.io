Got their boots on the ground  
Who knows better what's coming around?  
Surviving each day in grueling condition  
Elect the homeless, the peoples politician  
Not just a bum, just down on their luck  
It's not always a druggie lying on the sidewalk  
But a lawyer, doctor, your friends electrician  
An economy failing leaves workers in submission  
To the market, allegedly free  
this wage slave life takes your family  
On this stressed out ride from check to check  
It doesn't matter when you can't pay that  
Bill on the table, vetoed, no jobs  
It's the other party who's always at fault  
But it's the people, the working class  
Bled by the liter while the top gets a pass
