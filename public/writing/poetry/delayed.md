The hot sky crimson like the heat of my rage  
look through the window the night burning away  
no reason for waiting or given but say  
a few minutes more, hours wasted inane  
a troubling circumstance and helpless besides  
wait for an answer, wait in line  
An unhappy moment, a clerk doing their best  
whatever makes it work, what worse could come next  
Another delay, another, and another spill  
of my trust in this system and all its ilk
