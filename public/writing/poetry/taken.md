All or nothing, no hand to fold  
do your best, work hard, do what you're told  
Plan to be followed, plan to be made  
In whom do you trust? Yourself? Your faith?  
Consider each moment with care and grace  
gauge yourself slowly and never lose face  
taken from you, each piece you held dear  
friends, family, locations that are near  
as all slips away, as ties come undone  
wallow no more and rise with the sun
