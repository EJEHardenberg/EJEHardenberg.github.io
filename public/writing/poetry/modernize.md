Both Perry and Carter seem to agree  
Hypocrisy is the downsize beat  
Add a new piece and upgrade that tail  
New shine steering, a mushroom veil  
Over the world powers that can't seem to see  
The king's gone back on his noble peace  
Take away more, and let bombs choose the scale  
More likely to be used, in war, all's fair
