It hurts really bad doesn't it?  
Conditions stable but your wallet's unable  
to pay down the bill that the doctor ordered  
Wondering what to do, how will you survive  
your family can't pay it and the hurricane's arrived  
whirling with emotion, in and out of your head  
sleeping off tension, but your leg's still just bad  
filled up with fluid, infected and going numb  
it's swallowed your life now, there goes the fun  
times that you've had, and moments that you've shared   
with strangers online you never met or dared  
to ask for their names, or anything else from them;  
just a smile or two, and a hello good mornin'  
Close to them despite all the miles apart  
You ask for their help and they respond in love  
Pictures to make smiles, words to encourage,  
videos to bring laughter and your soul flourishs  
It's big how small things like a hello  
can create a familiy for those feeling alone
