Always a comfort when your words come through   
a medium of impartial noise, yet loving too   
A dream of fear, and a hatred of self   
but a hand from no where lifts me out   
Just checking the mail, no expectations left   
dimmed eyes and red from losses of the dead   
yet here and there an encouraging note   
motivates me to continue, keep this life afloat
