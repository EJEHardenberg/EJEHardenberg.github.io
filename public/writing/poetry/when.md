When all the countries of the world are vying for the stage  
The bombs dropping down, fighting old vs new age  
When is the crux, the call to action  
The declaration that war's here, and not an over-reaction  
East or West, their armies converging in one zone  
The people pushed out and the world watching stoned  
Unable to declare, not for an inactive congress  
But no nation to wage against, we're stumped for progress  
A network they call it, this underlying terror  
Inspiring the actions of radical failures  
The overwhelming sensation, international pain   
pushed by a media that has everything to gain   
capitalizing on the sorrow and tears of the nation  
Running ad after ad while condeming indignation  
At what point does the mantle come down from the shelf?  
When anger overflows, and people fight at inconvenience to oneself  
When [starvation] is used? a war crime without a war  
What is the response, when can one help the poor?
