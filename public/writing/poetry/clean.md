It's a mess. This space right here.  
This clutter that brings ill thoughts near  
So many people, passing through with no regard  
Funny how we let it build up this large  

So: breathe, inhale, crack knuckles and neck  
It's time to exhale and step into the vortex  
Pull out the towels and dish out the soap  
A good scrub, and the thoughts will stop. nope. 

Desperate to change what is to what was  
Reverse the clock, find the cause?  
Was there any surprise that it would be like this?   
That given an ounce of hope that it'd go all amiss?  

Wipe the dirt off from the floor  
The hopes were up: expected more  
Should have stayed low and gazed to the ground  
Eyes to the sky, Icarus's foil found  

Hours alone just cleaning to think  
Memory's chains: where's the weak link?  
Take a foot out of the past  
Is anything still in my grasp?  

A few days more and I might again find  
An hour or two of moving peace of mind  
dancing in and out of lust for you  
What's the point if I'm never true  

The room is clean. But I am not.  
Taken the dirt in, sickness caught.  
Blackened with soot, my own pollution  
Was I really looking for a solution?

Nothing more to scrub except myself  
Look around, isn't there anything else?   
Watch in reflection as the dirt drifts away  
But when it's done, what thoughts have stayed?
