The plates are spinning and the bets are off  
The words too strong, the bitter draught   
Death throes rampant and idealogical prose    
The burning of a culture, the line that was toed   
One step over the oppressive have taken   
Crying out with lies of an identity forsaken   
Entranched in field without any no man's land   
Letting nothing slip, liars spoke but tipped their hand   
Collusion without condolence and a plot unveiled   
Out in the open the change comes but is truth entailed?
