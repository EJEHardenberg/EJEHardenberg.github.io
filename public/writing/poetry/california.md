It's the dangedest thing! All of a sudden   
I'm having these thoughts about what once was sullen    
Well, truly, they've always been happy memories    
But for a while they hurt to feel and to read    

Yet here I am. Staring out of this window    
An old bus trip down, and thinking of California    
At the thought of the roof, on which we sat and swayed    
Or the red of the sun, in which my hands waved  

Mountains upon mountains! And then flatness and still    
nothing quite like it over on this side of the hill  
Well I suppose we have seasons, unlike those breadbowlers  
and we tend to make our mountains out of molehills  

I digress though—and setting both East and West aside—  
Don't you ever think back on those good times?  
An orange off a tree, and a piggy back through the park  
I'm chuckling now, my fellow travelers must think me out of stock  

No shame back then, and still no shame now.  
I'm happy with who I am, and there's just no foul  
to remembering the better times that we once had  
Despite this distance, I'm still just as glad.
