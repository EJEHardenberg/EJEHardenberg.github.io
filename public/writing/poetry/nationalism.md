The mother and father look down at the hand  
Reaching for comfort, curled, spanned  
This little treasure that smiles at them  
With what future fates you? Lovely baby man.  
  
Crawling then running, laughter and play  
This darling grows up with no complaints  
Too young to know what it meant when they fell  
Only the anger, fear, his parent's silent tells  
  
Symbols of pride, political blustering  
Boosted by hopes, joins fellow countrymen  
"We're in the right", no other opinion  
Ready to serve this land's holdings in  
  
Another country, another tale  
Baby wakes up, to a missing father's care  
Never will they know, that gentle affection  
Given before leaving, dying for protection  
  
The example is set, this is your duty  
Wake up, work, resigned to futility  
The war on the step, it rears like a snake  
Poisoning the wells, of any friendships you make  
  
Death. Famine. The consequences from afar  
These two boys meet, line of sight, alarm  
Hoisting their weapons, each feel in the right  
Serving your country, on others a blight
