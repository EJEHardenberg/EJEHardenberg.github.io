Flipping coins like you've been flipping positions  
Matters of security? Well they best [be tried for treason]  
Oh wait, no, if [it's you] not Snowden   
Then I guess it's a straight shot to a state's election  

So many times you had a chance to confess  
You [screwed up], but [you're unwilling to redress]  
Done up in ideology, the shoe fits [less and less]  
Guess it doesn't matter now, no one cares about the mess  
  
When you're [turning on your heel]  
putting aside reason for mass appeal  
So long as you look strong  
You can [eye-roll] all day long  

[Laughing] at the death of those under your protection  
[You assured them it was fine], no need for a correction  
Roll your own system, [it's worked so well before]  
But now there's "too damaging" secrets knocking at your front door
