Once white painted curves upon each side   
The destiny of all things to this cries   
No words to give up or offer here  
Yet each day onward the cracks leaking tears   
A rose inked in, vividly furled  
closed to the heart and close to the world  
grounded in air with nothing for base  
when falling to shatter why save face
