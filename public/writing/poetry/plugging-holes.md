The balance of hope and despair zero summed   
another day to bury another day to overcome   
plugging holes with leaking covers the rain falls in   
nowhere to drain to, directed elsewhere, just sits to spin.   
Churning away and gnawing at helm,   
ports gone to starboard crashing into hell.  
Falling away and into the darkness without stop  
no brakes on the air, no rope to pull up
