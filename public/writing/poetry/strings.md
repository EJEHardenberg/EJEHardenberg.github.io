Tipping and toddling the old man is rocking  
back and forth the sea crippling and jostling  
underneath the raft the serpents slipping past  
their tongues as oil into ear shot crafting  
  
With little to spare but words dancing on air  
and no action to shake the world of its fate  
each slip of the tongue, each wrong unsung  
correct me not and no harm be done  
  
Ignorant to issue and empathetic bringing tissue  
to paper with pen the law written blood in  
call "land of the free" and "great harmony"  
smiling to say: "there are no strings on me"
