Change of seasons. Change of pace  
Budding leaves on trees showing life's trace  
Cold still on the ground several feet high  
But the world's waking up, we are still alive  
A constant factor, an evergreen  
A heedy feeling, this freedom ring  
What will come and what will be new  
A mile over and it's as if on the moon  
The magma glowing and the floor shifting out  
This closing on the past and the leaving of doubt  
What do you offer now? What can you bring?  
To pull me out from this snug shell again
