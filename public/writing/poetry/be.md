Be informed but open-minded  
Be vocal but not disruptive  
Be understanding but not complacent   
Be cautious but not fearful    
Be organized but individual   
Be your own voice but one of many  
Be idealistic but realistic   
Be skeptical but ready for truth  
Be what you want but within reason  
Be mindful of hurting others but unforgiving of those who do  
Be ready to denounce misinformation  
Be critical of others, but also yourself
