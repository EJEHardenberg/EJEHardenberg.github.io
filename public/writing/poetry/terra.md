Back in oh-one we fired up a new era   
Exploding onto the scene with the war on "terra"   
An [8 minute speech], and an 8 year reign  
of sanctimonious actions with none of the blame  

Racking up the kills and gunning down combatants  
didn't take too long before the people had had it  
Rising up to the pain, and bearing arms we trained  
struck back at the violence of invaders insane  

An eye for an eye,  a thousand kills for a kill  
Suicidal bombers, running headlong were filled  
with a bullet to a head or an [apache] instead  
[journalist or fighter] who can tell when you're dead  

Militaries morals panting bringing up the rear  
when you dont ask or tell you've got nothing to fear  
Lady liberty looking on while the Patriot's gone wrong  
mass weapons of destruction to the constitution's swan song
