It's hard to speak about these things  
That are going on in my head,  
I wish words had wings  
So that they could migrate south instead  
Of nesting in my mind  
with no thought to the genocide  
Of the happy feelings in my brain  
Or this irritating pain  
Of a reminder that it's not you  
that's always who on the bottom line   
on every contract that I sign  
What burns me up the most  
Isn't just what happens when I choke  
But the silence that I say   
while I go slowly insane  
Trying to bend this to my will  
Wishing that if I just had that pill  
My care would melt away  
And the body which I'm forced to stay  
In this moment I'd be free   
Not for just more than what I'd be  
But a Phoenix from the ash   
A deliverance from the past  
To look forward to a future   
Where I'd say that I could see her  
Smiling back from silver on the wall  
With no worry or fear of standing tall  
But a pride bursting out   
with red sticked lips rounded in pout  
And a figure to cut the time   
with no reason left to rhyme   
Run away now and live a brand new life    
Just you and me, a husband and a wife
