A cornacopia of noise, a whistle, a sigh  
burning up with liquor, a confidence, a surprise  
assault to that wall, the indeterminable liquid   
of courage. Of hope. Of absorbing conservative    
for a friend, for a wing, absorb the blow  
defeat taken in stride, another time another go  
With perservererance and time skills are honed   
Speaking to others, convincing, a task to elope   
For the friends and companions, the hard work always due  
being the right hand wing man, the results are never for you
