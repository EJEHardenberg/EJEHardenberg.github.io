Drifting in and out, the sheets pulled overhead  
Dipping into dream and then breathing real again  
A thousands times awake, and a thousand times fallen  
asleep under rain and within head a darling  
Awake yet again, to see the backside of strangers  
walking into the mind, and sharing in dangers  
Rolling into the next, and once again unsure  
of dream or reality, and the breath stands inert
