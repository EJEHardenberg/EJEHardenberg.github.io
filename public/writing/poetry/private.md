Building up the case, stripping out the data  
doesn't matter where it's from use it for later  
falsifying origins and faking up the facts  
be there at this time, tip off that hat  

Nothing to hide, nothing to fear  
ask yourself, why're the 3 letters near  
creeping on your letters and chomping at the bit  
facedown for freedom and constitution takes the hit  

Target or not, sucking the well dry  
store it this day, haunted for life  
One word's all it takes, commit no crime  
sympathize wrong, abigail's eye cast the die  

Letting off the hook, convenience for you  
Laughing at the alarmed, "who cares what they do?"  
Waking up to a word stranggled secure  
but bars go two ways and it's you who's through
