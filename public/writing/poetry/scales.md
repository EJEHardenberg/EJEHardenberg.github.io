Shifting the balance and dropping the gold  
Weighted actions each with story unfold  
A new habit here, and a new habit there  
Empty the mind, making room for hot air  

Time used quickly and quickly used up  
The will to proceed ground to a halt  
Learn a new way, find hidden paths  
the mind with no feet, always traveling last  

Disarrayed thoughts and every idea scattered  
phrases in hand push aside ideas that matter  
skipping the rind and pushing ahead  
nothing to capture, continuous dread
