A chance encounter and a casual mention  
Now you're on a stage without an audition  
It's your pain they want, that real in your eye  
They can't understand, but they'll say they'll try  
You pick out a tune, it's how you feel  
Does it matter who's fault landed you here?  
Where you are now, you're just making do  
Not easy to live with no home or food  
Can't shave or clean up, a ruddy dirt face  
Scarred and marred by the concrete place  
you called your own 'fore the blues pushed you out  
keeping the peace, you move along with no doubt  
that they'll forget you soon, a creep who's too near  
Got a story to share, but ears all turned in fear  
Guitar in hand, you recall a simple tune  
[G B C and a melody about a loon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXlzci1rKNM)
