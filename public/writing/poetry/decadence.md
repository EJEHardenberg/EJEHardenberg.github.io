Putting words together like they meaning something at all  
Building up your boots, like mud in the fall  
Chin up, buck up, gotta stand high  
So you can answer, when someone asks why  
Why do you do this? This meaningless thing  
Playing in decadence, like a two piece king  
Wasting away each day of the life  
While thousands lay dying, throat under the knife  
But that's not me, you kick and you scream  
I'm different, special, just living the dream  
Craving that feeling, or something close to it  
Wrap up that needle and establish the habit  

Playing out the story but never being the star  
Just a passive observer, always too far  
Never making a move, or speaking your mind  
Just settling in, write a letter and cry  
Out over there your home where your heart  
Last took it's stand before falling apart  
Still the bruise on your knee from bending down  
Another lifetime maybe, but this castles crumbling loud  
Holding onto the vision, this foolish delusion  
Of coming out of the shell, shrugging off seclusion  
But that whispered track that burns in the ear  
The doubt, the hate, this self-misservient fear  
Every time, each word, every burn, absurd  
But the hand on fire, it's a lesson never learned
