Red underneath with embering glow  
springing underneath the sun's streaming flows  
over the sea's misty shores and mountain's messy spikes  
the lilac scented winds blowing gently until night  
each color shifting forward and burning hotter each hour  
the blue and purple hills rolling over and outward    
Blocked houses and apartments, each story telling tale  
of children and parent, of legacies that fell  
onto shoulders of youth each opening their ears  
to hear the decades of adventure conquering all fears  
What rhythms the cadence of drums within halls  
booming with brass the brazened heedful call  
the mirth of the tuba and the roar of the bells  
sweetened in melody by violin's swell  
Ages gone past and many moons sunk below  
the red and sombering of sun's final glow
