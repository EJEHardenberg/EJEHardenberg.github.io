I forgot to say: "I love you", as I boarded my bus away  
I was caught up in a moment, of when I couldn't stay  
Stepping inside, fumbling with change, find a place to sit  
Trying my best, trying too hard, feeling on my face a twitch  
The tears in my eyes blurring the mind as I realized what I didn't say   
Your hand in your pocket and a smile on your face, other hand up to wave,  
I waved goodbye, fidgetted with bag, and kept the smile on my face  
Trying too hard, watching you go, thoughts streaking the palace of mind  
Sit on my hands, keep to my seat, and tell my heart to stay  
I forgot to say: "I love you", as I boarded my bus away
