Rattled awake by those in need  
Inward focus shifted out to the streets  
It wasn't nothing that called to arms  
The people, the nation, those ill and in alarm    

The more inequal the people the later the sequal  
of what should have come nearer for those fearing their lives  
from what's up next and what might never come   
for the balance of power between who's alive  

Say what you say and will it to be heard  
but the mics been dropped and nobodies learned  
Moral tacitation and the intented statesmen  
can't save you from your own inebriation  

Drunk off the power and losing the will  
you'll give up your morals as easy game to kill  
for the poachers and lobbys, the big money big house  
isn't that something, a lion turned mouse.
