I miss you.   
But feel like I shouldn't say  
Afraid of rejection and being lost  
Trying to hold on loosely to what little I've got  
Scared to voice an emotion, scared to let the feelings leak  
Where did the love go? 2 hearts enter, 1 heart leaves  
over dramatic sometimes, passive at others   
always the same desire, to be once more lovers  
so scared to say this aloud and to be discontent  
you're happy, that's what I wanted, shouldn't my wounds be mendt?  
I say I want you to be happy, I tried to let go  
to support you from afar, to disappear, alone  
old habits fought back, talking is what I want,   
trying to communicate but feeling distraught  
can't seem to shake it, this feeling of lost  
my head says mistake, your smile says not   
Yet I can't stop thinking about what's been dropped  
At odds with myself because it's really two things I want  
for you to be happy, but for me to be part  
I should be content, happy that you're so free   
yet selfishly I want you back, smiling at me   
while I wishfully think of things that'll never be
