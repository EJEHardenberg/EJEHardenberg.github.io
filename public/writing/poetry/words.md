Darkly stepping over street, shuffled gaze lowered down   
Don't notice me. Don't notice me. you're making it through   
A group passes by without reproach, no heads turned round   
The next step is solemn, yet here comes the few   
Jeering words, mocks, a square hole that didn't fit   
You're not what they want, they're lined up to hit   
Don't engage and try to stay out   
but the feelings are felt, the damage is dealt
