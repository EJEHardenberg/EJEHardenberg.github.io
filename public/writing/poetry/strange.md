Isn't it strange?   
Reading stories you never knew,  
but feeling the same as the tellers do.  
Isn't it strange?  
Feeling that spark in your heart,  
that triggers the memory, that starts it up.  
Isn't it strange?  
How years can go by,  
but a cut can still look like it never dried.  
Isn't it strange?  
When you're alone by yourself,   
and you just want a friend or to be someone else.  
Isn't it strange?  
That you smile and laugh  
but in a moment too soon, the feeling has passed.  
Isn't it strange?  
Trying to keep with the times,  
you're left knowing nothing, watching from the sidelines.   
Isn't it strange?  
When you meet someone new,  
you're often left wondering what you should do.  
Isn't it strange?  
When you run out of words,  
you look for inspiration, from what you've already learned.  
Isn't it strange?  
How you feel the need to talk,  
But can't seem to begin, like your throat is stuck.  
Isn't it strange?  
When you know who might care,  
you self-censor and hide, never mention nightmares.  
Isn't it strange?  
Whenever you lash out,  
Testing the limits of when friendship turns to doubt.  
Isn't it strange?  
When you want to apologize,  
for just being you, but your eyes are tired and dried.  
Isn't it strange?  
How we all fall in love,  
looking for connections we could have never dreamed of.  
Isn't it strange?  
When you think you're well,  
But it was you all along, dragging them down to hell.  
Isn't it strange?  
That you shoulder the blame,  
only on yourself, when it's not all your shame.  
Isn't it strange?  
How you need to forgive,  
yourself more than all the harm the others did?  
Isn't it strange?  
When you cringe at the thought,  
you're thinking constantly, about what you've wrought.  
Isn't it strange?  
How you hit this spiral,  
And the thoughts go down, tumbling viral.  
Isn't it strange?  
How at the end of the day,  
You can still love yourself, no matter what's played.
