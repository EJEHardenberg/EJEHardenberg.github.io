Everything's good,everything's fine  
You're keeping busy and walking the line  
Busy with work, bettering your mind  
You're doing real well but you've got something to find  

You had it long ago, but now it's far away  
That part of you that pushes, the muse that went away  
Self motivating now, you're striving ahead  
But it's not the same, when it's just you in bed  

Waking up in the cold, just sunlight coming in  
Roll over and reach out, but it's just a have been  
Little on the mind, just phase it all out  
Time to go to work, there's no time to pout
