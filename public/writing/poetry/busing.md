It is a nice thing this familiarity  
Just us talking, you and me  
No one else along for this ride  
Just the two here til end of line  
Day by day this comradery holds  
Until the time comes to shift the road  
You'll drive a new and I'll stay still in time  
But I'll miss you friend. Even when you're behind
