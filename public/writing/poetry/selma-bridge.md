Stand off. Eyes burning through 'em  
starting to walk, children and women  
What will stop the baton of injustice   
Will it be militants or civil discourse    
Won't you listen, won't you talk?  
Sign your signature, parry the flock  
of pressured and lied to masses of men  
of clergy and moral crusaders who've taken stand  
Even stepped aside the air thick with death's fog  
Bow your head, turn away, having prayed to your God  
A time comes again, paying off no one but the patient  
Stand before your nation, testify your dissent
