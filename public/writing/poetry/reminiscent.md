Reminiscent with friends stories of past  
Recalling good times, a smile to last  
Fallen out of touch with a faithful companion  
Encourage to reach out and not to abandon  
Blood thicker between than with their own mothers   
Despite life changes the two still brothers  
A message sent and a hope raised  
Triumphantly replied to, friendships second stage
