Moved to tears as love floods the wounds  
An ethereal embrace and unwavering truth  
Searching for answers, questions plagued my mind  
Peace and safety, offered from a hand so kind  
the neighbor you need, not the one you deserve  
A true friend indeed, who came to fulfill the word  
Of God, of man, of degenerating societies  
This thing I know, with him I'm at last at ease
