Can I carve it out like a peach?  
This unwanted feeling, replace it with sweets?
Muscles are tired, not just the usual sores  
The ones in the face, they don't work anymore  
What to do about it? It's a change that must be done  
not by others, by me, I'm the only one  
Who can fix this? This slow slide down the hill  
I can see myself falling, but don't care for the pill  
I'd rather talk it out, discuss things with friends  
but burden others? How could I ever make amends  
It's not in my nature, to admit to every fault  
To admit all the stupid, mean, horrible thoughts  
"If you've got nothing nice to say" was always the rule  
But when you're quiet for so long, you feel the fool  
Easier to smile and nod, just leave everyone alone  
Think about talking, but back into hand comes the phone  
Not calling or texting, just fighting the internal war  
That urge to talk but the fear of alienating more  
It's the hedgehog's dilemna, and I'm running away  
I don't always see the point in the day to day  
Why bother complaining when there's no one to listen  
Just deafening silence, day out and day in  
Even when I lash out, call and cry for a friend  
No help forthcoming, just a shrug as they hit send  
Laying on a couch, watching another watch a show  
Wanting to reach out, but words are left fallow  
Disinterest in others, it starts out so small  
Brick by brick we build up a massive wall  
And who will disrupt this? Who will be my Berlin   
Could I even ask this of someone? Who has nothing to gain?  
Flip flop on the issue, feeling aren't tied down  
Stuck never moving forward, and forever burned out
