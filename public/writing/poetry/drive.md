Bring on the fire and pedal to the floor  
driving the desert and rigged up for war   
in each hand the gun's locked and loaded  
a rebel running from anger exploded  
Bring out the human from madness inside  
the head of a stranger, hardly alive  
Instinct to run, and instinct to kill  
life's given up on and no longer a thrill  
wasting away, counting days 'til death  
humanity growing on you inside care has crept  
Let not their lives be wasted alone  
but bring them to saftey, in old home.
