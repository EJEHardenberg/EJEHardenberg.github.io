Surreal and unattached on an issue no one knows  
The look in the mirror, the parting of doors  
brick by brick the walls have grown strong  
love thyself, know theyself, how could one go so wrong  
with nothing to hold down, or even to catch  
the body will float up, only minds the net  
letting them down, each goal, one by one  
the soldiers they carry, desperate to do no harm  
not even doctors, of hypocritical oath   
could soothe the tanning of a mind fresh with rope  
wrapped tightly and entwined with needles in fear  
closing eyes to the blind, and soldering ears  
layered in cake, yet no time to have it  
only metaphor's left, own tongue defeated  
looking out through the window at the back of a mind  
irony, unwanted, but never short on supply   
The feel of a cloth, cut from the parents own  
doomed not to follow, what no oracle foretold  
yellow life, a crippling and souring regret  
without those to alleviate, what to do with the stress  
unleath the inquisition, no rock will be go unturned  
hunting grounds of emotion, seeking out that one word
