They say the chips will fall as they may  
But with a rigged deck who's got the say  
Keep the bluffs up high and the people too  
When you're throwing them out as they vote for you  
It's not really the money that you're gambling with  
But a different head on a different stick  
Give up and fold, nod to compromise  
A political party only barters in lives  
When it's talk or reform or lies on the stage  
The cost is the same, the penalty to pay  
Cut a budget there, think big not small  
Don't the numbers sound good when they mean nothing to all  
the bigs on the hill and the ones with a mansion  
As they dip in the coffers of your retirement pension  
Everything stacked high as they teter on top  
Keeping position by shilling for people unbought  
Will it tumble down? This house of cards.  
It's a cancer they've got, freedom marred  
One side thinks they're terminally ill  
Shutting down the nation to kill a bill  
Other parasitic and attached on the teet  
With a fascist greed powered by corporate elite
