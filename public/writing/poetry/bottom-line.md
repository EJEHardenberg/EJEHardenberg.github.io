when my chest hurts and my legs burn  
Should I go to a doctor then?  
when my smiles gone and my stomach turns  
what comedy should I rewatch again?  
when I'm down and out and can't pick myself up  
who should I reach out to for help?  
when your friends all left and you've drained the last cup  
Where to place the blame but yourself?
