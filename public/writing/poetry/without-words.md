When I have no words I know you will enable.  
The Lord of my heart who comforts me in all  
what would I be without that babe in stable?  
Though I struggle today, tomorrow victory calls  

Your love is like a breeze upon my cheek  
Pushing my hair as a father to an infants   
My shield, my sword, my armor, I am weak  
But your strength fills my jubilance  

With what words could I thank you for this?  
By faith and works the sinner justified   
An empty check written, signed by Jesus   
In all things, I seek you to be glorified  

They will know you not by our boasting of charity  
But through love poured out as water from rock  
The raised one who is most high offers serenity  
Only to those who bend an ear and halt  

A hardened heart may soften over time  
Like a river tearing through a mountain  
You too work in the most harmful of lives  
With open arms you smile and beckon  

Without words I cry and lift your name  
towards heaven my empty voice cries in praise  
for you are with me always through the day  
and in night, your side my pillow stays
