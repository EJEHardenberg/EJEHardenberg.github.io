Mouth zipped tight and channel's closed  
The daily grind, the words transposed  
From head to lip, touch to type  
No response, circle closed too tight  
An inch worm once, butterfly long ago  
Burned too bright, now can barely glow  
The strain and effort each interaction takes  
Leaves short the breath while the heart aches  
Cards once held close, haphazardly tossed  
Across the board, the game feels lost
