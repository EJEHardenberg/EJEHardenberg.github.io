Lift up your head and peer up and over  
Wasn't it simpler when you weren't growing older?  
But now life's coming, it's stretching your wings  
And you've just started to enjoy the simpler things  

The tilt of a chin: inquisitive and cocked  
The tug of a smile: lifting a down face up  
No longer rushing all over the town  
You've laid a root, you're protecting it now  
 
Cradling the babe so new to your life  
Careful to shelter, gotta steer the ship right  
You're smiling a little easier, taking a firmer stance  
For family, for friendship, for your own second chance
