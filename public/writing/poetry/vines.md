Crawling green and binding to surface    
The day is now and the rays nourish  
Where no one will grow you'll sit among friends  
All gnawing away to the same ends  
Slinking into shadow but never far,  
the building of a drapery spanning all  
Construction of nature, choking and wrapped  
Flaying away at a constructions back.
