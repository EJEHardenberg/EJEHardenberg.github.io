Small dark patches of water speckled the sidewalk. Coalescing as the
clouds overhead, puddles began to form underfoot and soaked into the
cracks between each slab of concrete. Muddying and mixing loose sand and
dead leaves into a whirl slowly slogging down the gutter of the road. 

Amidst this churning scene, the nose of a small black pup edged it's way
between the folds of an old pizza box. The hint of grease and cheese,
though diluted by the heavy air and water, still wafted from each panel.
Scent driven and cold, the dog curled up onto the semi-dry earth beneath
the make-shift shelter, whimpering quietly as its quivering body shook
violently to stay warm.
