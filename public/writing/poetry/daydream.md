See what you want to see  
Not the grey rooted in reality  
Think you can pick and choose  
But it's not that simple, silly fool  
Hammer, chisel, another nail  
Got a wall in your head, senses fail  
Knock it down like you knocked Berlin  
You'll find black and white can't get in  
To the place where decisions get made  
Nothings that simple, who's going to pay  
What changes first, where do we turn  
Too many things to just cut and burn  
How many would die for your naive dream  
Just because you couldn't see past the extreme
