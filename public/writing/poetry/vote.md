325 voices of those who fail to see  
the quiet lie, the slipped-in secrecy  
Only 100 stand to oppose, hopelessy outgunned  
who will stand with them? who will turn tail and run  
Those who would hope, those who may dream  
those who stand together in honest legacy  
What words can I say to let thought be free?  
How hard must I try to turn away your apathy
