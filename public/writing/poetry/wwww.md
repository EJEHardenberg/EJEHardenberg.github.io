Where do you stand?  
On the left. Right. Non-dichotomical.  
Where do you fall?  
Your own choices sometimes hypocritical  
What do you wrestle?   
Gripped and awake late at night  
What do you care for?  
Willing to lay down or stand to fight  
Who do you defend?  
Against odds, ends, means, and injustice  
Who do you hate?  
Their opinions just rub wrong and incense  
Why do you feel that?  
Perceptions and conscious made up and set  
Why did you choose this?  
What makes one over the other more correct
