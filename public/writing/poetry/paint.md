Today my hands stained  
With works in paint  
Commiting time in your name  
Funny how a few simple moments  
Shared between new friends  
can make such happiness amend  
the lulls in life and the pain  
one sometimes feels  
As the pressure of the world rears  
its ugly head to take a bite or two  
ripping peace with fanged tooth  
But yet here we are  
In this warm and splattered house  
Sharing a meal, sharing a beer  
Unexpected, but welcome here  
You, your family. The goat's beard.
