Forgive me this,  
to raise emotions long laid down  
I read a letter you see,  
a note from the past  

Why is it truth rhymes with pain  
In feeling what could not last  
Long gone, my longing,  
So distant: our time  
So far my care it seems  
Numb when you're not close 

Broken, sometimes yet, without care  
Would you mourne me I wonder  
That which has died  
Would you recognize me?  
No. I think you can surmise  

I stand on a Hill  
Not over, not stuck  
I stand on a Hill  
No feeling of doubt  
Over We are, heard you over and out  
Yet here I lay  
Not moving, without.
  
I'll try my friend  
to take the next step  
But if I trip once again  
Forgive my sin.
