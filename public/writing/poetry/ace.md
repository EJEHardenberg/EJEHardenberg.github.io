The sun rises again, letting one know:  
try again, try hard, try and you'll go  
far from your past troubles and fears  
just give it a shot, don't be cogs in a wheel  
Proven yourself again capable and ready  
embark on my friend, keep the helm steady  
each venture with loss or sometimes with gain  
playing the cards, gambling life's old way  
taking the risk, not sure where cards fall  
the dealer will call, where's your ace in the hole
