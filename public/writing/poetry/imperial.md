Boo to your policy that pushes out lies  
That bludgeons civilians for our "allies"  
And blast be that taste, of blood spit in my mouth  
As you tear open the wounds unhealed in the south  
The sins of the father are not of the son  
But here you are blaming me for some  
Divisive your rhetoric, and unfounded your cries  
Drumming support from those who sympathize  
But it's not the facts of a case, or law to abide  
But your own feelings, too much your pride  
To leave a legacy for children who won't understand  
In your haste to make, you laid waste with your hand  
To the rights of the many to protect the few  
To the powers that be you sat down in the pew  
Listening to the gospel of globalist perspective  
You tear down nations and call them defective  
One vision of the world and you're blinded by lust  
To make things in your image, power corrupt
