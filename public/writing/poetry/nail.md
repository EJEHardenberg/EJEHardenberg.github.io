The chalk of my nails as I sit and I sway  
Watching this file as I keep hitting replay  
The laughter mixed in with my peace of mind  
It's an odd thing maybe, but it's all I can find  
To relax and breathe, stretching out on the bed  
Grinding back and forth the thoughts in my head  
No mind to the world, no worry at all  
Just me and this chisel, and a nail too tall
