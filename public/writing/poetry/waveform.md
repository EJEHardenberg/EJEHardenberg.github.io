Collapse the waveform, send power through the system  
of checks and balances, armies of hands on petitions  
Ready to sign their name t' stay out of harm's way  
political protest staged and ready every day  
Where are the people? Where are the calls  
to rally, to raise, to bring up your arms  
to lift each other when one can't do all  
but together united a 1% falls  

A committee meets behind their double decked walls  
no oversight, no rulings, just agendas too tall  
for their robes and for the ones wanting exceptions  
Judiciary decree, extra extra, hypocritical deflections  
Not hard to see the ruling caste fearing  
the lulled sheep driven furious by feeling  
Bring out your hearts, critically compose your minds  
Together we might stand, but divided nations die
