Sleep refuses to come as the mind unravels  
torn apart by more than the days travels  
jet lagged and sickly, the head filled with ill  
what could be worse? A deathly disease or a death of a will  
Thinking inside, and lost in thought  
Who else to blame for the loss but the self  
Many words are that burn through the night  
The mouth moves along, but no talk comes out
