More often the perpetrator your own same sex  
Playing the victim. They'll have none of that  
Rolling out the stereo, and classify the type  
Push comes to shove gotta beef up the hype  
Round up the men. An' tell 'em not to cry  
Gotta man up man, got a country to die  
For century and eon, slaughtered like cattle  
Walking out to the war for the glory of the battle  
Sword, blood, teeth or gun it's all the same  
Dying for others protection, while they protest in your name  
  
It's just this world we live in, upside down and wrong  
Peacefully living isn't something for all  
Greed and fear puts corruption in the heart  
Bring out the punished, it's their shackles you've wrought  
Freedom to be, harassed and subjugated  
By the same damned fools who would have been elated  
If you'd been born one way or from another mother  
Doesn't matter now, can't transcend your color  
The few blind ones telling others the way  
Ignore the visual, under skin we're the same
