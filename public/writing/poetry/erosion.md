These canyons of the mind  
Built grooved over the time  
That we spent each day  
Was heaven, but now pray  
How do I stop the flow  
Of the river sorrow  
When I can't get too far  
Without feeling this scar  
Too shallow and unhealed  
Still tender to my feel  
Even covered by bandaids  
I just can't rip off what's laid  
Down by the years  
Of sentiment and tears  
Can't liquidate this investment  
So I write but can't vent
