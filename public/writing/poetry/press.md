Why let the man speak if you're not listening to the words  
Pretending to consider, but you're just waiting your turn  
To tar and feather, to write down your attack  
If you're going to be obvious, why even misdirect  
Claiming one thing when it's not really what happened  
Your internal bias, an objective distraction  
Did we see the same thing, or are you hypnotized  
Fearing friends'll leave you for your thought crimes  
It takes more than one person to consider and agree,  
But a yes man's useless for a press claiming to be free
