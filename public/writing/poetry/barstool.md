Smooth dark wood and a slightly musty smell  
It's the place he goes when 'e feels unwell  
Hungry or thirsty, it caters to all  
Who's to judge the loner at the bar?  

It's not unusual, at least for him  
To find himself sitting here again  
It's a comfortable place on top a stool  
He's become too apathetic to feel a fool  

Years ago it felt lonely and sad  
But now it's the norm, he's done being mad  
The drink he stirs, one elbow under hand   
Not strong enough, his usual brand  

The music so scratchy, an old showtune  
He hardly listens, his ears turned toward gloom  
Noises of the bar, ice and drinks clinking  
It doesn't register on the ears of the drinking  

Away from the world this small castle of stone  
Walls high, moat dug, praying for sins to atone  
The past brought present by the force of habit  
The man sinks down, his mind has had it  

No longer able to listen to himself  
He listens to patrons, their hearts on the shelf  
Next to the whiskey, rum, and wine  
Their troubles deposited all in due time  

They all leave, slowly stumbling out  
The sober man stands, pays, walks proud  
A blistering wind slaps his unguarded face  
Reminds him of another time and place
