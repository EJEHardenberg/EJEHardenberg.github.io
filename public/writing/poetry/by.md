Appreciate, that was the word.  
Of which I said to attempt an unfurl  
of gratitude of happiness, of sportsmanship and leadership  
little gone by but gone too long  
Each day passing the empty hall  
A moments look, a quick respite  
emptiness returned and bitter bite  
Unexpected, this room's lonely view  
of bile truth and harshest news  
still stamping down, embracing the pain  
as each moment in mind engrained  
let no one know, and bury inside  
the unshared truth, always quick to hide
