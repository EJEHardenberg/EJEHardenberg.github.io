Striving for the top and sticking to the plan  
Dedicated to the end game, the commited man  
In for the long haul, and a rich history ahead  
bringing out the best of himself, pride filled and fed  
Surrounded by glory and life long ambitions  
Accomplishing each one, but with no one near to stand  
Leave them all behind in quest of your goal  
Who will stand around you, when you're placed in the hole
