Everyday's a news day so why's today already feel old  
Everywhere a victim, a hater, a truth not being told  
War, not love is the commonplace;  
Can you be surprised? People filled with  Malice. Hate.  
Living a life without comprehension of state  
Never knowing where you are, your feelings always late  
Apathy isn't hatred, but it's not much better  
Don't you get tired? Of feeling numb forever?  
Open up and you'll start to feel,  
Start to feel and things get all too real.  
Submission and silence are two of a kind  
But it's easier that way, aint it? losing your mind.  
No words can stop yours from being heard  
Except your own, when you throttle your throat  
with the words of a defeatist who'll never fight elitists.  
You'll leave a movement dying a fetus:
never to see the world that could be sweetest.   
Stop sitting down and start sitting up  
you'll never get around town if you won't leave the block  
Victim as a culture is yours to change  
boomers soon are gone, worlds yours to derange.
