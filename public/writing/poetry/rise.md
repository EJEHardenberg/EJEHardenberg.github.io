Just to get a rise, flippant and free  
with your words and your lies bringing up the greed  
each worry and care you throw to the wind  
just to get a laugh, to speak rhetoric again  

Bringing out your cries and lifting up your lambs  
When will you stop? What's the end to your plans?  
Dissonant and unsatisfied you forget what you hear  
if it disagrees then it's in one out the other ear  

uncaring and without, you leave others behind  
so focused on your ideals, you drop it all to find  
that at the end of the road you're hungry still  
and nothing can bring you joy or thrill
