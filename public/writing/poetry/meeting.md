An embrace between two, and a smile and laugh  
The two meeting first, impulse to react  
To the sudden change in plans  
To the thoughts exchanging hands  
Brought together in one night for a time to chat  
Common places between kick off and that's that  
With shared basis between and smiles on face  
The two saunter into the night: a question: my place?
