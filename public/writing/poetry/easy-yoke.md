Open not just a home, but a heart to those in need  
Not just a wallet, but a smile given glady  
When asked for the quarter, provide the half dollar  
Walk not just the first, but the second and third mile  
If you have ears to listen then listen tonight  
It's an easy yoke, and given the spirit, a burden light
