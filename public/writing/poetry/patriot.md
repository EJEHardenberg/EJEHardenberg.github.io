Shocked, scared, but willing to be  
A new born man in the land of the free  
Crying, trying, learning to walk  
His own thoughts he soon adopts  
Schooled, ruled, taught to nod  
He loves his country, no second thought  
Travel, battle, weather the storm  
Patriot abroad is a man forlorn  
Love, lost, his romance: lust  
Taking his fill, of the world he trusts  
Smiling, dying, an act of war  
Board that boat, in the sky drones soar  
Friends, foes, his gun doesn't know  
Just point to shoot, and the hole will show  
Years, tears, the terror feels  
Memory tricks into thinking it's real  
Hurt, torn, so battle worn  
An old man wakes to the bugles horn  
Smiling, dying, his eyes unlit  
The dead man dies a patriot

_Note: At least part of melody here is from another poem, but I can't remember the
name of it but it had something to do with patriots as well. If you know
it please let me know_
