Vicarious this worry and thrill,   
Shaking your fist, but you're watching still   
The images play out, live updates and feeds   
You're not helping out by feeding their greed    
 
Sensational! A positive word once upon a time    
Now you've the deaths of thousands burned in your eyes    
Sex, war, angst, and fear.   
Making a profit on lives spent year after year    

It's news! [What people want and consume]    
But did you have to glorify them? Go out with a boom?   
Is [that] ok? What you [show?]   
Do you care for [truth] or business growth?
