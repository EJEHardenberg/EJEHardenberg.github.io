Through the glass door opened in the sky your hand extends   
The cuts, scars, and red lines laid across matching rimmed eyes    
Blink away the pain and smile again as you say it will be ok    
Okay for one, but not for both, suffering silence to pay the price   
What world to live in pulled upwards into, unexpected this false heaven   
clasping your wrists and holding onto that which is most dear   
Shattered the freedom granted through sacrifice and pulling upon torn walls   
The universe heaving and burning before you, its rewrite falsifying truth   
A demon reborn and cursed to her life, for a moment in time to enjoy once more    
Love. The hidden shall be freed and where will you be   
will forgiveness for your lifting burdens be given freely?
