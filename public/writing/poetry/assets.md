Sitting tight with a foreign occupation  
Sovereignty of a nation?  Not during an invasion  
Who called them in? Who said they could help?  
Got that NATO border to enforce and nukes to tout  
A stalemate and a no win situation  
But here comes a guest, brought in by the nation  
The red scare scaring the blues with each victory  
Tactical assaults with a no quarter military  
Bombings and force, enforce the regime  
A killer's country and a refugee's dream  
Under pretense, spread that capital wealth  
Fits with ideals, not with a religions mouth  
A fatwa a democracy can't make  
Can't give up the gun for the west's sake  
What do you do with the frenzied radical?  
Can't talk 'em down, fundamentally incompatible  
No debate just war with a foot in the door  
Guard the allies you choose and cry some more  
As the assets you crave slip away to the grave  
Of the thousands murdered under your watchful gaze
