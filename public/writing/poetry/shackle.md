Shared cause and goals unite as one  
Hold your head high my hero unsung  
pushed and shoved but yet never trampled  
so quick to jump for support, to risk the shackle  
impulsive to help, impulsive to aid  
where do you stop? When you're swindled? Unmade?  
Crusading for justice, whose justice, which day?  
Stopping no where, always risking, for you I pray
