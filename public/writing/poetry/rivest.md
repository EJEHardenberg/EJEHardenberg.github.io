Read headline, byline, the content so hypocrite  
Telling all the plebs: "no no you can't encrypt"  
Give us the lock, and now give us the key  
Nothing to fear? Nothing to hide? Please.  
Your secrets worth protecting but ours? No way.  
Give it to us superiors, above your pay grade  
United we stand, except when privacy's on the floor  
Rivest will tell you, but you're response is a snore  
Headline after headline, your security is shit  
Letting hackers and crackers get in with no hitch  
No punishment planed but "proportional response"  
What does that mean? Oh right, I got a hunch!  
Bait and tackle, Ammunition for your war  
On masses that won't listen to your tired old lore  
Scare the people with each alarmist screaming high  
Pray no one will listen, try to turn the tide  
In court, in print, each governmental plor  
What to do, with encryption, less is more
