Sitting at home, connected but not   
Communications firing, but no one's caught   
Morning spent asking for a favor   
Morning wasted expecting a savior   
Enforcement of solitude, a silent prison   
Hoping on threads, and hanging on slivers   
Negative replies when silence broken   
wetness of eyes as truth settles in
