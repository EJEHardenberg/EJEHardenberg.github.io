Cool and blustering winter day    
Inside home, in bed do I lay   
hot tea, steeped well, with a swirl of milk   
a blanket warm, a caress just as silk   
bring to lip, the lovely mixture   
stained tea tastes the kiss of a fixture   
of mind and memory in loving past   
the girl who standards made, whose fill is vast
