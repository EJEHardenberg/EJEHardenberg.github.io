He smiles and quips  
Not a likeable schtick  
When he's under the pressure  
bravodo's in the weather  
Like the rain of cash money  
he throws down like honey  
to get out of his cell  
when he's called on the hell  
he puts people through just like you  
humble CEO? How about capital fool  
You can push on the fanfare  
Grievance and beat ups aired   
Talk up those dark roots  
but you're a con man, left parted hair  
like a mad man bad man, wolf on the street  
you've got a persona, telling all what you eat  
but that's just an act, it's what's portrayed  
Who you are inside, a man who's self made  
public image aside, it's what you do that matters  
and when you start looking in, the image shatters  
you're trying to get out with as much as you can  
A shameful display, you know if you were an honorable man  
You'd listen to what they say, instead of brushing it aside  
But I guess that'd be hitting you on the bottom line  
Claim to stick it to the insurance companies  
Is that a PR strat too? Or just your pedigree  
Listening to too much, and hopped up on manhood  
Take a seat son, you forgot decency and do good.
