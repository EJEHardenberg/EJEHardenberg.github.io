Irrational response, a burden of proof  
Unrepressed resolves, convictions believed true  
Your words are as daggers, heated in flame  
when the cut of innocents flow only yourself to blame  
How much is enough, how many must you harm  
Will you back down and surrender, what's cause for alarm?  
A detonation over landmass, a big boy for you  
Did you ever expect your own words weren't so true  
Your insults may hurt and fill me with shame  
but in your mind you'll know, that we're one and the same   
Two humans we are, despite bickering squabbles  
Look beyond a difference and remember what matters
