Worry on the free ride you're promised since birth  
Digging holes deeper grinding face into dirt  
Ostriches, sheep, humans far worse  
Dragged by themselves complacent in mirth  
Riding the coattails and never looking hard  
At the lives they'd have if they didn't idolize  
Their leaders, their peers, their oligarchs hand  
Never biting, always feeding, no answers to demand  
The senses so dulled by the sites they have seen  
Burned bodies, cut throats, and yet no one screams  
The violence, the game show, distracting each eye  
As the stage of the world in tragedy sighs  
Disaster, cataclysm, holy wars of faith  
The race war. The class war, perpetual hate  
States in poverty and struggling, nations in decline  
Each pastor predicting looming end times  
With so much to feel and media broadcasts world wide  
Does it surprise you to know I'm desensitized?
