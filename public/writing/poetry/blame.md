Taking a risk, going outside  
words on the screen, dying alive  
the messages sent, such trivial things  
looking for friends, empty meanings  
of promise and hope, with nothing to float  
the head above water, when "nothing's the matter"  
a little help reflects little asking  
when no ones around, when sitting and masking  
the doubt and the fear, of change and near  
the crux of it all, the blame sits here
