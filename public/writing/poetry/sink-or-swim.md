Floating in place, this ocean around  
Learn to swim, avoid flushing down  
Enduring and climbing through each day  
Tidal waves and undertow, pray it away  
Soggy knee's limp with treading the path  
Destination forward, or perhaps it was back  
Confused now, no hollow or bubble to hide  
diving for answers with no light to guide  
sink or swim, keep an eye on that breath  
faulty made, or just broken at best  
break through the surface, time and time again  
the deeper the dive the more water lets in
