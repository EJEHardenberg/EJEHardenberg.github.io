Safe across the pond we watch it all on the news  
Murder and bloodbath, like we've nothing to lose  
Dip in the Dow Jones and now we care  
While the bombs we pay for rain in the air  
Just a building or two, [that hospital crew]  
Without a border those doctors tried to make due  
But it ain't nothing but a flaw in logistics  
Running down the numbers 'cuz lives are statistics  
Other combatant, no civilian harmed  
Just another body peppered with scars  
Got the chopper over head and they shootin' ["nice"]  
A father is dead and his children on ice  
Turn your head away, it's something you don't see  
But would you take stock and stop it if that body was me
