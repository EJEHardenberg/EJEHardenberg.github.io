Liberation from the left and the right   
between the day and the night   
What views have you held  
Concerned and reserved with the conversation turned  
what words turn to shatter when you say nothings the matter  

[0:38]
Will you face it yourself, with no hesitance  
Will you stand back up, defiant and bent  
to twist the words of a lamb who on a platter began  
their life as a sacrifice to your moral action  

[0:48]
What you leave behind is all that they'll know  
when you're gone, what's left over in the after glow  
of the bombs you dropped and the seeds that you sewed  
What world to live in, your children, the fill ins  

[0:58]
Look in yourself, Look at your neighbor  
See their eyes, Not just some player  
A person, a man, a woman, a stand  
a way out the gutter if you'd just lend a hand  
Care for each other, care for yourself  
be a little selfish, but don't take without doubt  
one for all and all for this together  
don't drop your head, we all are saviors
