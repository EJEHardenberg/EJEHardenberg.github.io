Drums are kicking down the door again  
While that guitar is whining along with a voice  
The bass hits low and I think of a friend   
Detached and indifferent but I still make my choice   

Should I hang out with you at all I wonder  
What boils underneath you's released only in fumes  
Toxic and choking, fed by golden liquor  
I'm no masochist, but I want your smile to bloom  

At what height do I escape and breathe fresh air  
What cliff must I jump from to feel unimpaired  
Searching for answers deep in my roots  
Despite your gnawing and snarls when I do 

Calm, collected, ready to smile on a dime  
I ask how your day was, but never expect rhyme  
A different me and I might have been hurt  
Used to it now, I watch to stay alert  

The usual stops, the usual things  
The day by day slug of pain   
Living for oneself, I was told long ago   
Is wrong, shameful, and will lead to the cold  

But if I don't focus or turn deep within  
How can I hope to ever fall in love again  
Years ago I lost what brought me my joy  
"Be more selfish" she said amid the noise  

To love another is hard enough  
To love without loving yourself is too tough  
Seeking answers I walk along the beach  
But it's low tide and I'm anchored too deep  

Cut the chains and leave the ship to sink  
Or drag it along for another minute to think  
The ebbs and flows of life will come soon enough  
Don't bring me down Bruce, I know you've got it rough
