Hands shaking over board as the words chasm forth  
Eyes hardly focused, the head in discourse  
There's little to be done and too much to be said  
What matters is ignoring that voice in your head  
The laughter at failure and the glory in defeat  
The one that says you can't when halfway deep  
What words to give to pacify your worst demon  
Sol'darity, comforts, nothing breaks the feeling  
When darkness outside clouds the eyes  
and the thanatosis burns one out from inside  
Look for that love, look for the people  
though not always able: they're willing to reach out  
Not what is done, but what could be given  
If fate didn't demand that all bets are even  
perhaps you'd be held in a lost lover's arms  
or coddled and made sure, protected from harm  
When wrestling inside with self loathing and hatred  
fantasies, cherished ones, all help to make it   
kindness in all shapes: even when self feels defective   
You'll make it. It says, you're not yet defeated
