Flag over face and rainbow over eyes  
Do you think it matters, that you're unified?  
What do your words do, just still on the screen  
while you do nothing, and sleep another dream  
Poor water on your head, forget to write the check  
it was fun for a moment, so who cares what's next  
Wage war from the keyboard, spend all of your time  
workin' real hard, while not spending a dime  
Share this picture if you agree, an ad to your friends  
screaming "I'm part of this", while you stand still again  
Solidarity or silence, there's no middle ground to choose  
With us or against us, the facists thought that too
