Ginger sunset spilling o'er water  
little above to grasp for the climb  
each loss bringing a day tougher  
than the last with no respite I'm  
pulling up straws and breath lynch pinned  
collapsed lung and staring, giving in  
rolling over once, twice, and staring up  
ceiling above with no hole to see stars
