Woken up by the spilling of the blood  
When it splashed on their euro  
And signalled the flood  
It wasn't some crisis for humanitarian aid  
But a blood lined pocket  
That broke the facade  
Who would say you care when it's been nothing at all  
To watch the union countries,   
borders grow tall  
While the poor, the lazy, the people on your boot  
Dry up their funds, and sell off their roof  
What could you expect when a borders belly up  
An influx of migrants, playing welfare have nots  
Among the pretenders real people needing help  
But that extremist presence? Guess nothing else  
Matters to you when it's your turn to pay  
For the carnage you caused from "logistical aid"  
The barrel bombs falling, each bought for and paid  
With stamps on the side. American made.
