A simple change, not considerate of all involved  
You thought you could rely on them? It's a fraud  
Without any care in the world, they change what they will  
It's signed off, dotted, see it? Right there?  

You blinded yourself, and agreed to their terms  
Gave up the freedom, and here's a lesson to be learned  
The greed and desire, they'll trump the silence  
Shut up, it's not right, but it's not always fair  

No thoughts about you ever passed through their heads  
Maybe a persona or doll, but never a voice in your stead  
Just a quiet nodding bobble, a smile on the dash  
On this long road to ruin, you're clamped down fast  

Will you sink with the ship and do nothing at all  
Won't you stand up and say something? Or put up a wall  
of apathy and sloth, you'll find plenty of your kind  
In the bowels of the streets, no food but hive mind.
