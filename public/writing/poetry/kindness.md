Rain on the step and dodging the greys  
walking by when I stop and stay  
The thought of a meal, warm and tasty  
draws along, towards a bowl of savory  
a wait and mistake: not with the party of two  
just by myself, a single seat to sooth  
with device on hand, a single numbers game  
absorbed from the world, mind away from the pain  
A moment too soon and suddenly relaxed  
when memory hits and breaks the camel's back  
A light downward tune plays through the air  
arpeggio's running with mind ensnared  
As she hands over the check eyes flash to mine  
Did she see the rivers overfilled with brine?  
Vision shatters as focus shifts to top  
a small note enscribed: "thanks a lot!"   
Signed by a name, this personal inflection  
mind cast down: kindness doesn't mean affection
