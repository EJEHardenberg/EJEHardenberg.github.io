A nation pleading the 5th while it bleeds the 4th   
From the well of your voice, nothing is poured   
What's happened to the people who once fought?  
They've got nothing to hide, because your silence is bought  
By the wigs upstairs saying you've nothing to fear  
But they bump the bill when they whisper terror in your ear  
Tear yourself away, from the t.v. set in your room  
It's not the media who's the problem, the problem is you.  
Get off your couch and take a step outside  
It's time you took a stand, time to have some pride  
In the rights you have, the red blood you've got  
It's more than enough, to be a patriot  
There's only one duty for a citizen  
Fight the system, it's time you had rights again.
