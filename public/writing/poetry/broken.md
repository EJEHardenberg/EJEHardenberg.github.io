I wonder sometimes if something's gone wrong  
did I break down on my road?  
While not discontent, it seems to me too long  
to sit by myself alone.  

But if not for this silence and Chopan's minuets of tunes  
—of which only one half dances slow—  
When would I reflect? Or inward look and grow  
up to embrace a broken world.  

World of wonders, small, large, and some unsung,  
to their tune I dance and twirl.  
Caught in the spin, a friend pokes their head in  
unashamed I grin like a loon.  

But this is just me: the man who smiles and laughs  
who says, on his mind to only a few.  
And even to those, secrets I hide  
reserved for maybe only two  

Not always the same, the ear to my woes:  
can't burden too many friends.  
Though often unpaid, they accept payment in spades  
of my smile when I look up again 

To the sky my eyes turn, perhaps too often now,  
searching for something up there  
Blue skys or grey, it doesn't seem to matter,  
if I were to say: “take care”.
