Sit with this empty canvas in front of me  
Ready to spin tales or grieve calamities  
Not every word a truthful tale  
Grains scattered. Enough to leave a trail  
Which portions are meal? Which merely sugar?  
The glee of clever, caught hook and sinker  
This childish notion that the mouth echoes the head  
How long will you put up with being misled  
A literal is worrying, unable to see  
The heart of the voice, the emotionality  
Intuit your way, find the path  
You could have better, put aside your wrath  
Look not at the how of words woven here  
But the why, the reason, the logic is clear  
Confusing as is, there is a time and a place  
To take the value of words on their face
