Six days drowning, grasping for the light  
what happened to you, where's the fight?  
beaten down and broken over all these years  
did you give up and let go? What are these fears?  
A quiet reflection, the humming drone of a fan  
It's hot out and sticky, but you've shivered again  
When do you break down? When do you cry?  
Too proud to break down, too numb all the time.  
There's no cause or reason for a feeling too far  
Wish I was sleeping, but I've noticed a scar  

The feeling's dried out and hardly there at all  
Tomorrow I'll feel better, hold myself tall  
But this moment of weakness, of feeling so thin  
stretched on a canvas that I once felt akin  
to my aches and my body that just don't quite fit  
I'll stare into the dark and then look back in    
In this moment of solitude, of feeling for once  
An assessment is made. A heart is renounced.
Is that what was needed? Sad lonely reflection?  
What good does it do? This quiet confession.
