It is a quiet sky  
Blue with longing, clouded by silence  
The distant mountains hazed to purple  
Light, free of cages, burst through the clouds  
An instant, it is over and now the world is no longer quiet  
Ruptured, heated and hot wind lashes the air  
Quaking the earth, the tremble begins  
louder now, louder now  
See the upheaval and the burn  
the world engulfed in blaze  
and we call it what we will  
We call it liberation  
But liberation is not freedom  
We call it civilization  
But civilization is not freedom  
We call it what we will  
But we do not call it what it is.
