Heat of ash burning through moral's resolve  
the wounds given out as if nothing was wrong  
forget your humanity, forget this tabboo  
Do it for your country, there's nothing to choose  
Aim the rifle and aim your eyes  
take notice of no one, ignore their cries  
subhuman and unworthy, you bringer of light  
let nothing distract you from winning this fight  
Belief of a good thing, believe out of fear  
they're going to get you, they're always near  
The war is on your doorstep, or so you think  
take the offered kool aid, there's plenty to drink  
Forget who people are, forget where they stand  
Forget what could be, if no one forced hands  
For pacifism expressed, of naivete accussed  
For warmongering and death, patriotism assumed  
No heart will you win, no mind will fall through  
If for a moment they refute all you said at face value
