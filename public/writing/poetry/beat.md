Bobbing up and down to the snared static hit  
Building up the tension with dramatic rifts  
Volume swelling while the music hits the crux  
Crying out with fury as the tears level out  
Nothing to gain from floodgates opening the door    
Yet here you are lying and begging for more  
What will be said after the mind breaks free  
of ill effects and drugs, of pressured humanity  
Standing on your own again with hazed over vision  
Looking around new eyed and worn away passion  
nothing to be said of that which once gave pleasure  
stare at your hands again, what next will they master?
