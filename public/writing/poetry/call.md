The call to differ and be what is new  
Strong in some, long lasted in the few  
Self-importance must be told time and time again  
make a difference they say, be your own change  
What little is known is what most must apply  
The days blend together, the struggle, the cry   
to rally and hold your banner ever higher  
what will you bring to the old's funeral pyre  
as the phoenix fire rises where will you stand?  
Tinder for the spark, gasoline from the can?  
Consumed by your cause, or crippled by fear.  
Fear of what may be, fear for what's loomed near.  
Cracked and wounded, mind cut open and fried    
The last days of a noble, nobleese oblige.
