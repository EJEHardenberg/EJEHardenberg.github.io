Did my words reach you, when written in ink?   
Stray thoughts with no home, but ours briefly in sync   
What I left behind, did it come to your attention    
the day dreaming thoughts and the unsought affection    
what was the feeling and where did you go   
in your head or dreaming, thoughts taken below   
Am I present sometimes? In minds eye a simpler view  
of desires and wanting, with no reality to skew   
A fantasy sometimes, written for one   
a world I'd construct for you, if in it we'd run.  
through fields, rivers, oceans and worlds  
flights of fancy traveling with our sails unfurled  
in my power to give and in my mind to make  
anything imaginable I'd give, wouldn't hesitate  
for fun and for pleasure, what words would you say   
if all you had to do was say yes any day
