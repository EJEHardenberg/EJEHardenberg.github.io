What words will you choose on this occasion  
filling the cup but leaving all unsated   
always ready to go jump to a cause  
the immediate, the short sighted, the feelings will gnaw  
outrage and emotions at an all time high  
ready to channel? direct it and fly  
with leverage and hope we'll win wars yet  
when inquisition calls, whose head's in their net
