Unmotivated and bored, with little to say  
Hard to think with rot in your brain  
What's to be done? What's the cure?  
Find a new flag to raise and unfurl?  
  
Try new things, it's as easy as that  
Calm your mind and take time on the mat  
Pump some iron, feel that burn  
Read a book, new things to learn  
  
The first step is hardest, second: worst  
Don't you give up, before your third course  
Enthusiastic once, that cannot sustain  
Keep on keeping, you've something to gain
