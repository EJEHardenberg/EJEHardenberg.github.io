Two people laugh while working through interaction  
The smile and humor expressing affection  
Not of desire or sexual need  
But brotherly friendship, a shared creed  
Hard hats on, yellow and bright  
A job well done, production of might  
Soil and grit, hammer and nails  
Building structures and blowing wind into sails  
Harumph, heave, ho and ha  
The bulkhead mounted, the flag flown  
With duty done and lots cast  
They stand tall, tall as their mast  
Neither take claim to the fruit of their struggle  
Shared in their joy, their labor together  
End of the day, retreating away  
Their job well done, all night they play
