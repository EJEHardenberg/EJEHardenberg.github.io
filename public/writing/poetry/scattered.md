At this spring's end we came and gathered  
To say goodbye before to winds we scattered  
It wasn't sad, nor bittersweet.   
But just right, a victory, with scotch neat  
Seated six at the table round  
Smiles and laughter all abound  
The rain came and went until all alone  
Our group sat and the barkeep groaned  
More than enough merriment for their staff  
But they asked to close after our fifth draft  
We smiled, stayed, and had one more  
Even though that mom only gave half pour
