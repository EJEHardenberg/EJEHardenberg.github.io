No red blip to savor today, no endorphined notification     
A network to connect and a dying neuron firing slow   
They say it connects you, but you've never felt so alone   
The glare of the screen brings water to the eye   
Yet it's nothing that compares to the feelings welled inside   
Each passing day, each moment displayed on screen    
Yet nothing gained from looking in and 'liking'   
Reach out, cast your net. See if anyone's home     
A real life meet up, a moment without a phone    
Look up from your device, look me in the eyes    
No machine between, but a human and their pride
