Each day eyelids roll up and consciousness clicks  
Stand up for yourself, or sit down and chomp the bit  
Every moment going by a decision you make  
Feed the negative, or take control of your fate  

Laughter is what a body always needs  
Burning the darkness and smiling so free  
When reminded again of just how much one can love  
a mindset to change, feels like mana from above  

teasing the language, a laugh spiking the head  
with kindness in heart, two friends shared bed  
nourished and happy, a cuddled brain begins  
to form a thought, perhaps victory to win
