Creation of a product, a tool, a cog   
What we're here to do, to be used, to be called.   
Nothing lasts forever, and so we're in luck   
an endless amount of problems given, always in muck.    
The days are long and yet we do not complain   
of the hours spent cursing our very own names   
The joy of achieving each and every goal   
is tarnished by realization, there will always be holes   
Nothing to be done but grind teeth and buckle down   
work all night if neccesary, never giving up until laid in the ground
