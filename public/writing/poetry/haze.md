Fog begins to roll in    
sweeping over the streams of air    
bending light over sky's porcelain    
morning and frazzled fare       
The cool nipping buzz of september's start    
batters faces with fall's birthing pains   
winter coming suddenly, its lonely heart   
cannot wait nor enumerate the days
