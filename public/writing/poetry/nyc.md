This gridded mountain range towers overhead  
The streams of humanity winding in between each pillar  
Each a place, to go, to be, to lay their head  
The city is its people, the voices that lead her  

With what do they paddle and whose hands do they trust   
What die has been cast that dyes their minds decision  
Is it the wrong move, or is it reaction that enough's enough? 
Uphill or downstream, the votes are counted in succession  

The will of her sailors, the strength of the crew  
Smile my friend, the sunrise is cresting above the waves  
Lapping at the beaches, an orange smile replaces a blood moon  
Waking the dutiful and guiding to bed those who misbehave
