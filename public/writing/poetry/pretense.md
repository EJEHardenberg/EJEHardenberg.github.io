Is it cruel to say what's true  
I'm not inspired at all by you  
But to play the pretenses well  
I'll continue smiling while I dwell  
On all the things I like about you  
yet none of this ignites me to do  
Anything more than I must to maintain  
friendship in which we've gained  
Nothing of consequence and nothing new  
A carnal exchange in which no spark grew  
But to think of the past is against my law  
Never compare, only forward stand tall  
This sunset I watch, burning out in bright hue  
Sets behind my back, and I think of you
