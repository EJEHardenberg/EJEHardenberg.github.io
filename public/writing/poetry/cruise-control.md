Cruise control at 72  
Staring down the law passing by you  
Got the colours on and blues too bright  
Not pulling you over without a fight  
Slip of the mind, a tongue so stiff  
Not paid enough to pull the graveyard shift  
Drive right by, no mind, no heed  
The man don't care if you're doing speed  
He's got the night, got plenty of time  
To file his work and ignore petty crime  
Start of the month, don't have that quota  
getting up for nothing but a court order  
Gunning the cars and recording their time  
Decide on their bias who gets to be fined  
Ignoring the house everyone knows smokes crack  
For the honor to watch the rich man's back  
Some of the cops they fly so straight  
You call  'em a stick in the mud but wait  
They the ones you want when you feel slighted  
But keep up the hate and they grow too tired  
Protect and serve, defendin' the feeble  
Don't expect a God, they're only people  
Serving the system and trying their best  
It's hurts us all when a blue boy's put down to rest
