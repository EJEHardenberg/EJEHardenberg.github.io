What man are you that dominion of man belongs to you?  
Neccesitating your right to your freedoms unknowingly earned  
For what reason have you for your words  
Given no thought, no intelligence, yet still heard  
Mouthed with nothing in mind but the only thing ever on it  
You're a fool of fools who deserves no correspondence.  
Would a lecture tell you what you need to hear?  
Would submitting incarceration give you similar fear?  
In numbers you may laugh, yet alone what would you do  
tell me now, what didn't your mother teach you?  
A nation is great only due to it's people  
and what see we now on this street? Legions of sheeple.  
No place is perfect, but when all's run its course  
respect and honesty are dignity's recourse
