A laugh, begrudgingly admitted to a loss of the way  
smiling and brushing aside all in embrace  
childlike games of show and tell  
a day spent in peace, comforted well  
walking between city and wandering 'tween stream  
River flows through you, a requiem of dream  
The roar of the fall and green of the climb  
a break before city life, back into the grind  
An arm slipped in, a frolick pays no mind  
a shoulder to lean against, a friend for life
