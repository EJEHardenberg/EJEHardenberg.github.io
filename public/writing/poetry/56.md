56 dollars a day and that's tight  
Given that check but no right to life  
Can't work, no stamps, just in limbo stay  
How you going to pay the bills piled each day  
When you're ran down, beat down, sitting poor  
On the street with no chance of having more  
No arm around you now for 2 months   
Just the cops in the park , ready to pounce  
Should you fall asleep and fall down in it  
That'll be 5 oh ma'am, here's your bum tax ticket  
Down to six dollars and now you're looking round  
Told to eat healthy, only afford that quarter pound  
Lift up the spirits, trying for amends  
Hard to chin up when you've got no friends  
Even that best-y you've known since five  
Won't help now, don't want none of that drug life  
Argue and anger on the side of the streets  
Altercation spilling until you're in a court seat  
Convicted and sentenced, cavity checked and spread  
Brighten up buddy, 3 meals and a bed
