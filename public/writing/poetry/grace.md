Launched into this, balanced on the tip of my toe    
Leaping through the air and falling down as snow  
Bound together, by talent, by pain, by practice  
Years of hardship, but now perfectly balanced  

Curling downward, raising each of my arms  
Controlled falling, the actor in mock alarm  
But their hands to catch me, my fellow stars  
Our act to play, each stanza ours  

Coordinated this, not just two behind   
a moment of beauty, in love they've climbed  
No words, just acts, this dancing duet  
The audience thinks it, but it's no Romeo and Juliet  

Cavalier spinning round, six times in the air  
Catching not just himself, but the eyes so fair  
A light little laugh, and a pirouette turn  
The fairy comes out, her call sugared yearn
