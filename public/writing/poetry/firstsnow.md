Though the sun is still yellow  
and the clouds not yet greyed    
the earth has been whitened  
by dust falling from haze  
The green poking out through each small clump  
Brown timber standing still, some at a slump  
The limbs of the sentinels coated in off-white fur  
Each reaching out wondering what the sky holds  
Soak up the sun, drink from the sky  
The yule season comes, the fall withers dry
