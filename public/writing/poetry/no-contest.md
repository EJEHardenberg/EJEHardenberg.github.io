Staring into the mirror, examine yourself.  
It's looking like it's time to get off the bookshelf.  
Dusty, old, you've hardly been checked out.  
But your spine's still good, there's hope to this route.  

You smile and frown, pull on your cheeks and sigh.  
If not today, when? What's keeping you alive? Why,  
I remember how you used to stand so tall  
Proud of yourself, oh how we all can fall  

It starts with a disruption, a plan you skipped  
It's okay you say, I can make up for this  
One time, two times, threes times more.  
Pretty soon you're just lying on the floor  

Staring at the ceiling with no desire at all  
You've given up the game, what was it for?  
No aspirations to chase, or goals to grab  
The weight on your mind pulls with too much drag  

You used to fly so far on that post work high  
Couldn't wait for more, passionate cries   
But now here you are, an unhappy body  
Who's at fault? Whose responsibility?  

Nod and sway, feel sick if you must  
But you've gotta do it, it's you you trust  
Your own decision leading the path this way   
It's time for you to own up, it's time to pay  

So start tomorrow as if it were new  
Troubles not behind, but pushing you through  
It's the drive you need to begin to address  
It's you who can change this. No contest.
