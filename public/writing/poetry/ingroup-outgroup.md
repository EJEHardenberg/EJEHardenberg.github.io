Roaring with the pack, running down the hill  
Not sure where you're going, but got your cause to kill  
The other's they don't know, can't possibly understand  
Just how well this is thought out, how great this plan  
In your arms you trust, linked together in cause  
hold your hands up high, you'll make greater powers pause  
Unity through blank, feel empowered through X  
Give it all to your system, with no thought to what's next  
We are the leaders, leading armies against you  
We are the thinkers, armchair theory gone askew  
We are the people, justifying the push  
to run down the hill, just to feel the rush
