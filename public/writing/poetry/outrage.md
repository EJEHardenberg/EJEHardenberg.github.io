Pockets full of shifting issues  
Insecurity, bias, hate shown in lue  
of compassion and kindness, what's inside of you?  
Humanity or object, villified a fool  
Look beyond a mask, look beyond for the truth  
find what is critical, learn not to jump ahead  
emotions before thought should never stear the ship
