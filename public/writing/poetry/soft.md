these fragments below me on this in air journey  
are sometimes gridded and cut.  
But it's not in the east where the mountains peek  
Forming these rocky old mountaintops  
  
Sectioned and cornered, an unnatural order  
But so human. So precise. So neat.  
We burn through this fuel as fast we can  
Be it crop, grain, or creek.  

Nature is loved, but not human's at all  
For we consume, ignore, and cheat.  
To be the better, to best one another  
It's what drives too many to seek  
  
The planet our own: claimed, quarried, and loaned  
With interest we can never pay off  
At the table our bill, clean water, clean air  
the cost of our shepherding gone soft.
