Cool down. The Flare folding under horizon     
End of the season, a coal smouldering once more  
Leaves holding on, holding stronger somehow  
longer than before the emeralds of fields glow  
Not a change in their color, not an impurity in the batch   
Just bastions of jewels of summer not yet ready to hatch  
Upon the turn, the solstace night. birthing orange, red, and gold  
The flowers wilt slowly, the leaves curl and hold  
together they bury, under mulch for another long winter cold  
But for now, no change, just greened dew  
no worries of sweaters, no jackets, no shoes  
run through the lakeside, sliding around  
get home quickly, the suns about to go down.
