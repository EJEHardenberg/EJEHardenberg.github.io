Let no one worry, not even a mite  
Break down alone only self to spite  
Whisper that comfort and bury my head  
Underneath delusions of what's been said  

Crawl on your belly, just can't sit still  
Magpies and vultures eyes latched for the thrill  
Shine on like jewelry nestled in rough  
Burn up the fury pretending you're tough  

Some bring glory and some bring shame  
which side do you fall, are we the same  
make a decision the paths forked here  
Cataclysm hurried and all too near  

Wake up once more after visions of pain  
Those who once loved you won't call your name  
Nowhere to run from yourself or to hide  
Cuts running deep but you've put bleeding aside
