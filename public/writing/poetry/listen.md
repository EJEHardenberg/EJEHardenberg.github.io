Mirrored across the table, I listen to those words  
Similar situation, your pleas going still unheard.  
Such kindness and love you have for your friends  
Yet the return on your heart is a boot that rends.  
How many rashes now blaze across your cheek?   
Can you count the times turned, face wetly sleeked.  
Exhausted and worn, wondering if you're in the wrong  
When what's right has been done and nothing has come  
of your efforts to mend, to find a better way  
When people won't listen, what can you say?
