Spread across the step like too much butter  
You've got the hand on your head while going for another  
Comment or two, you're not seeing truth  
When you're spitting that shit with your head aloof  
Just this casual thing, your fried and dried joke  
At the man's expense as the words he chokes  
Just doing his job and you're laughing it up  
With your casual racism, it's got to stop.  

Sitting dead still, still paralyzed 'cause  
He thought he was equal in the eyes of the law  
But here you are dragging this country back  
Treating this man like a servant just cause he's black  
Do you even realize just what you have said  
Or were you thinking you're clever inside of your head?  
A jokes a joke, light hearted fun  
But when you comment like that you've got a smoking gun  

With your trussed up self. Make up too smooth  
How much time you spent could be better used  
Making the inside clean instead of the out  
Yeah his rights don't end because he didn't shout  
So here it is, my rhyme, my pissed off flow  
Because trash like you ain't nothing but foes
