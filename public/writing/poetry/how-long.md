I caught myself the other day thinkingâ€”  
how long has it been?  
Healthy or unhealthy, what's the time again?  
Three years? Nearly four just sitting,  
on my own unflinching

Here I hope one day to say hello  
To that round buttered nose that grows  
such a warmth in my heart  
that it spreads down to my toes  
I wonder do you ever also suppose?

That the next you see me, we'll high-five  
Call out in triumph that we're still alive  
The world can throw all that it cares  
I don't mind it, in fact I dare:  
to smile despite the world outside;  
to care about someone without having to pry;  
to give of myself as much as I can;  
it's ok by me. If you're happier than  
my letters ever make me out to be  
I'm trying hard, patient and free.
