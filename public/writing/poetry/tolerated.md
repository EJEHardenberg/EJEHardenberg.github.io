What an uncomfortable seat  
Surrounded by loligagging tweets   
It's a shame I've little to say  
Instead I think I'll pray  

Send me a friend, one who is true  
Send me a lover, to kiss away blues  
Send me an ear, listen as my heart beats  
Send me no riches, my love is not cheap  

Tolerate me no more, please send me away  
These false friends who can't spare me a day  
Give me a smile, something new  
My friend, your ear, please, give me you
