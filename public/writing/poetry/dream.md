Shifting the reality of the night twice  
First you appear. Cruel angel. Thrice.  
Can't stay asleep, waking when you look at me  
I reach for you but your shoulder's too icy  
Lips parted and kind words, but then it's over, you turn  
away from me once more, cold now, I wake alone  
Second she's there. An unwitting desire is born  
Enjoying the time spent, wanting a little more  
I kiss her head, look, then move to my need  
smiles and embraced, she looks up, agreed.   
In moments too soon gone, I dream then wake.  
Both of you gone. In my head, it's all fake.
