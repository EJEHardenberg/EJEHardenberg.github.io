Down you go and you can't stop the fall  
You're working it out but it feels too far  
A moment you want to just let it all out  
Sit down with a friend, no words, no pout  
Don't even let on that you're feeling a bit low  
Who wants to talk on a speed too slow?  
While you figure your maths, and come to a solution  
You falter and pause, no foreseeable conclusion  
So wind it back and begin all over again  
You never spoke up, no peep to your friend  
And this is how it goes, day in and day out  
Some days with many tears, others without  
But always alone in your crowded head  
Closing the door, laying down on the bed  
Throw on a song and try to feel something new  
Nothings coming. You're stuck here with you
