Off again, are you? So little time spent here.  
Imagination wanders but never too far or near.  
Berating the simple one standing still in his heart  
_What good are you? You can't tell dream from real_  

And under this abuse mind continues to burn  
though stubborn body refuses also to unlearn  
these terrible habits which push me apart.  
Try to escape it, but it's like I can't start  

No rhyme or reason, or even reason to rhyme   
writing these lines as if someone will take time  
out from their own problems to say hello  
Ask how are you, how are you not cold
