Standing on the hill what do you gain  
A view looking down? More of the same  
ways and words that once were decried  
Now lifted up, as if anything changed  
Where do you find yourself? where do you sit  
What issues can you consider that worth it   
When a cause you find is a cause you care  
Take up the torch, and keep it lit
