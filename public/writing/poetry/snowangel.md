Head down in the snow, arms moving to fly  
looking upwards, waiting for angels coming by  
lay there a while, turn cold and blue   
nothing will come of it, just like you  
time wasted instead of spent  
wittling away at the safety net  
the flakes fall down and struggle to stand  
why must it be this way, why's there no hand  
to hold anymore, to offer comfort needed  
bootstraps pulled, a change of season  
on the outside smiling and inside bleeding  
rise from the cold and decide not to die  
yet another day, which one won't go by?
