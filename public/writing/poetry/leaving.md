Click. The turning of the latch  
Doors closed now, there's no turning back  
A step forward, then two, then wading through snow  
The thoughts coming slowly, no home to call own  
The last words of each still fresh in mind:  
A wide eyed look and surprised goodbye  
A smile and wave, from two in addition  
Typical lingo to take it easy with trepidation  
The familiar smile and nod of comrades in arms  
And a handle asked for keeping online  
The sky outside grey and dismal in air  
but the heedy sense of freedom with which none despair
