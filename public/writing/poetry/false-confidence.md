Liquid inside and moving so smoothly   
the thought of yourself with confidence so soothing   
but the lies told to your own soul   
that a smile was meant for you or more   
ring hollow against the steps climbed inside   
the smile gone as the pair walk on by   
wingman or not this game no chance to fly   
what were you thinking? This mouth without speaking   
debilitating speech no pause to your drinking
