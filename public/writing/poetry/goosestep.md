Goose'n two steps forward and one step back  
You'd never believe it'd come to that  
Swing it left then right, legs walking tight  
On this rope we hang praying, for light  

Populous city, people doing their thing  
Don't bother me, an' I'll do the same  
No interest in the higher power  
'cept when the votes down, to the last hour  

Feel the burn, can't stump me now  
Political slogan somes only know-how  
That common man, kept too Damn busy  
Work for hours, get home, lazy 

No interest in that local ring  
Of politicians deciding their king  
Until he bleeds, from their decisions  
Won't make a fuss, living submission  

To the rich, the poor, the middle class  
A way to move up, way outta grasp  
That welfare check better min wage  
Then that entry position that never pays  

A few come up, those underdog tales  
Giving hope to a few, the rest despair  
There's no looking back when you've got debt in remision  
It's climb now, Climb, or get put outta commission  

The work to do, the changes due  
A system doesn't change just for you  
This turnstile game between the people  
Always swinging back under the grand prez's steeple  
  
No God or king, just an elected official  
Saying words of peace while launchin' a missile  
Count countries we're bombing but not too loud  
Snowden letting on to keep that ear to the ground  

Each day each hour a problem to address  
Never letting up, when you've got that Illness  
Got that junkies high, shaking an' never standing still  
The consumer life treating ignorant's ill  

What little there is to go around  
Swallowed by big fish, with promise abound  
To spread that feed among all its workers  
But costs are costs, got hidden shark lurkers  

So that common girl, she takes the loan  
Got to get educated, got to pick that bone  
Shut away for years from society  
When she gets out, watch out, up and coming  

With that social change, that drive of mind  
She worms her way inside the hive  
Every night she prays for her better world  
Everyday they try to beat 'er into the mold  

Buck up, face up, she's trying so hard  
Got that bill to pay so can't lose the job  
Eyes on her, the boss always looming  
Before too long, a CEO is grooming  

Making millions on the good of her word  
Got that white collar life, the pain too old  
To look back, feel trapped, walk in those shoes  
Thrown in the closet when she joined the elite few  

"A success for me is a step forward for we"  
Bring out the broken, bottom dollar charity  
Then write off the books, bring down the tax  
Goose'n two steps forward and one step back
