A single feature, like a hook on the line  
Reels in the memory from the depths of mind  
Her face unlike yours, but lip smooth and sweated  
Reminds me of yours after kissing and wetted  
Just a moment too long, too slow to look away  
Pale faced look down and to death I pray  
Better to leave than forever recall  
That feeling never returning of past times gone
