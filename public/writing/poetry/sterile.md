Here again in this sterile abode  
By choice maybe, happy? No.  
"Take care" we say as we wave goodbye  
Care of what? Do we ask ourselves why  
Our body, mind, family are all there  
No need to choose, but which "take care"?  
Walk in early, register your name  
You're welcome to sit, wait out the pain  
Into the machine you'll go in an hour  
Until then, sit quiet and smile  
Hundreds of dollars to look deep inside  
Then the doctor will ask why you cried
