The drudge of the past, pulling up each weed  
With each rock overturned a memory tugs the lead  
The mind with practiced loathing of biases ungone  
Brings out it's hatred, its repression undone  
Hostile thought and feeling unleashed  
A snap to the pain, an opening release  
Old habits not forgotten and new ones learned  
Self inquisition started, on which stake to be burned?
