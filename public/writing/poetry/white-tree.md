Unfettered wilderness bursting alive  
small pats of snow, a green reprise  
The needles pointed down, heads bent low  
necks of limbs heavy handed and laden with snow  
Fields of winter and pawprints scattered  
occasional orange of foxes dog hounded  
The golden brown of the trees dying too slow  
holding on to life while standing alone  
Come again winter and come each year  
the cycles of life come to all held dear
