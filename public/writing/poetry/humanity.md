Using that word again like it's some kind of insult:   
check 'em.    
newspeak thoughtcrime done an' now it's time to wreck them    
with facts and evidence you say, but who's even listenin'?       
"too lost in feels to believe what's real" you'd crack.      

But a stat is just a stat   
no opportunity of slack   
for the trapped and the cracked:   
the real human condition    
a label, a word, dehumanization ain't in remission   
there's a full blown cancer claiming the system    

call it what you want, you'll call it how you believe it.   
prejudiced eyes looking for what you're told is there   
patriarchical patronization pulling plebians hair   
matriarchical malaligned misandrists making men scared   
pick your -ism.  
turn to your -ist's.  
scream 'n' shout when you're called hypocrites    
based on a label there's no room to debate,   
  
yet     
  
common ground between but who'll brave the whirlpooled sea    
marked by mines and warheads funded by media's yellow creed    
destroying our unity and drawing the lines   
setting up each ethnicity to be marked for different crimes    
One people. One Nation. One law of the land    
Five eyes watching the power never changing hands   
  
Can you hear it? The cultures mix and mash  
Growing up poor middle but not without class    
Noblesse oblige? Help those in need?   
I'll be damned if I'm not the change I want to see    
Never forget, we're all one humanity
