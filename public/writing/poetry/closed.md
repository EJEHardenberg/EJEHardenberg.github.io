Sealed and shut inside your words  
a token of an age gone by  
what happiness there, what was the reply  
never to know, a promise keeping me outside  
binding of words and a pact made  
to never open, to set aside, to wait  
how long until a crack shows  
curiousity killed and heart snowed  
one thing alone keeping seal intact  
the peace earned justified in respect
