A rough hand coarse running across the chin  
That violent contact just starting to begin  
The fight, the height, that adrenaline high  
Lifting the spirit, as the two begin to try  
Wrapped in bands the fists blurs of white  
Mixed martial arts, and a slam to the right  
Two jab, one hook, and the blood starts pouring  
Sliced across the head he hits the ground snoring  
Fights over before it's even begun  
Raised fist the victor, reigning champion
