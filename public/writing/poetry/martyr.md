These are your sons, your daughters, caught in war  
The desire to change unrestricted to the poor  
Anyone can change, emotions stirred or personal gain  
Doesn't matter the reason, their hearts feel the same  
Washed of their senses, righteousness burning anew  
The ends worth the means, they'll kill for their truths  
Believing what they've heard, assured it's for the good  
Before they can be stopped, ash where they stood  
And what for, this loss? What price has been paid?  
A martyr for some, an extremist by any other name
