Reach for the sky my teething pillars  
Grey upon grey sweeping ever higher  
Cousins with green seeking to fill her  
Ne'er sleeping even through winter  

White with clouds settled below  
The swirls of purity stained by tracks  
A doe nourished with berry and bough  
Her eyes not seeing the orange attack  

Not the mind, but body belts out cries  
Crimson the struggle, the speckled throws  
Steam upon steam the yell lets fly  
Life letting go as the red runs dry
