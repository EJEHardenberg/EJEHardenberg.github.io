Take a dip with me over to our left  
Then back again and we'll rock step  
It's not too hard to get this move  
When we're moving together oh so smooth  

I'll take the lead and you will follow  
each of our favorite moves we'll borrow  
Smiling as we swivel step and sway  
isn't it just grand to dance this way?  

I'll admit, I've a bit of a crush  
but I belt-loop to turn away my blush  
When the music switches over to romance  
Our eyes meet, my heart joins the dance  

Isn't it lovely, just locked arm in arm  
Open or closed, the position feels fun  
No worries at all when our hands are together  
moving through the dance hall light as a feather  

Unlike our dance, always in constant motion  
Fearing the worst, I hold back that emotion  
Why ruin a good thing when it's not even done? 
The chance of more, but risk songs going unsung  

Swing back from thought, back to this moment  
It's time for a spin and time to enjoy it  
I'll spin you around and back to embrace  
Then pause: wondering how your lips taste
