Crawl from the synapses these tendrils of mine  
No reason, no logic, no loophole to find  
Just breaking down and not building up   
What understanding says and what deluge cries   
For time after time the brink brings near  
Never satisfied, lurking, under the mask fear  
Balance on edge the hasty words on tongue  
Wait silently, wait outspoken, wait for none  
Move on and on and on and on and one day find  
moved on from this place, this world, this kind  
Time left is long and nothing can retort  
The changes wrought through dwindled cohorts  
The words pour out, wordplay abound  
trying to make sense? no. Just trying to sound  
An ear given here will no doubt speak  
But why bother when understanding one cannot reap?
