Etched into place the bleeding heart sways   
Memories of passion in night come to claim  
The toss and flick of each stray thought  
Dismissal of each, in mind irons wrought  
With each kiss on mind in fantasy's play  
disenchanted reality, holding no sway  
Able to rend the brain along chasm  
Logic, emotion, there is little unfathomed  
Hallowed words echoed inward entwined  
Their meanings shackled and brought back in line  
To a word, a hope, a clinging principale   
"What love is acceptable?", a rebel yells   
The two forbidden and told they're a crime   
What difference is none, what fate is nigh?
