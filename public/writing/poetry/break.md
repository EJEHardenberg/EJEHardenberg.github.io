The situation different, the feeling the same  
Nothing will continue without a little pain  
But fear not now, my love's not waning affection  
A goodbye now may yet come to salutation.   
Worried about harm to which we both may cause  
But nothing could harm our past, in which I am awed  
No words but yours and mine have stood  
so high upon hearts as lovers have took.    
For which your house and mine may meet   
In rest, peace, some harmony  
Another time, another place,   
I hope that soon I'll see your face  
Without tear or leak in eye  
only smiles should be, for your heart is filled with grace  
as you came, and as you were. 
The first time seeing you, helping you unfurl  
into our home and into my life  
what feelings you gave on those hot summer nights  
Whom could we wonder, a god above?  
To bring us together, o'er letters sent 'tween worlds  
Yet another sunshine for a few months  
Nothing could be better than not being apart  
But not the time for sorrow nay  
our hearts yet still beat support, comfort, frayed    
When you are gone and when I am here  
When you are far but I wished you near  
I will think of spent time and unwind  
any feelings of guilt or blame in my mind  
Blameless but to love are we  
bound together with cruel twisted destiny  
to not be aligned in what matters  
But to be shared in feelings so unfathomed.
