This dirty cloth, stained with the world  
tainted by incorrect choices  
Lift its eyes up, crying for the clean that comes from raised voices  
In off key cry, and monotone gait, these notes fly to you, through the gate  
Past Peter, past Gabriel, throughout the heavenly chorus  
You raise me higher and provide perspective for my hardships  
Soften this heart, twist it from its gnarled hold on the world  
Your gentle touch, kind ears, and loving words my hard mood unfurled  
Teach me again, so that I might learn once more  
To love my neighbor, and to go and sin no more
