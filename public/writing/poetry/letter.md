Walk around, climb the stoop, shaking hands with the mailbox  
Inside, what do I find? But a yellow envelope.  
With gleeful grin and crooked smile
shred seals and reach to what's hidden inside.  
the words on the paper, the Mix tape (or modern equal)   
a warmth, the joy, my own letter to come as a sequal
