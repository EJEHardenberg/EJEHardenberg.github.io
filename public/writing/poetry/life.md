It's the only one you have and the clock is always ticking   
Why are you standing around?   
It's not like you're really helping.  
You can take a stance or two and make some real choices.  
Or you can commiserate and frown;  
And cut out nagging voices.  
Hard love's not always the answer for each and every problem.  
But too often feelings spared,  
Too quick on others we condemn.  
All's fair in love and war, or at least that's what's said.  
But it seems all's fair in life,  
Until you're caught or dead.  
Our essence is the parts of our past that define us.  
But you have a choice!  
Decide what you trust.  
Like a hungry mouth you've got to feed in moderation.  
Good in good out,  
But the bad's a war of attrition.  
Always a struggle once you've let one or two things through.  
So easy to give in,  
But look forward to the new.  
Idioms and catch phrases, so easy to dismiss.  
But ignoring wisdom of the past,  
You'll see a lot go amiss.
