It's dark  
Late, late at night sitting all alone  
Breathe in  
It's quiet and your thoughts aren't quite at home  
A moment  
longer and soon enough they're floating far away  
distant land  
or so it seems, that place your heart's to stay  
Over it  
Or so you said, but you can't stop your thinking  
I'm fine  
you'll say without ever hesitating  
You'll lie  
each day until you finally believe it  
Give it up   
They'll say, but you don't have to delete it,
