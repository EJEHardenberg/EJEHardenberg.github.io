Can't seem to shake it or move along that line  
Set the path and the goal, but where is the time?  
Always willing to try something, but moving too slow  
There goes life, slipping out your hand as you let it go  
Grasped too tightly, or maybe a little too loose  
Does it matter now? Lost it, kit and caboose  
So you wait here some more, wondering when'll it change  
The world passes on by, while you grow more strange  
Just a nail in the wall, screwed in a little too tight  
Can't move from the stud, dug in too hard for the fight
