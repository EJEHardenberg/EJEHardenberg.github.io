Fog of the breath, it's cold out the door  
Waiting in line, waiting for more   
Consumption, this path, that fills up the boom   
Flappers or millennial, both sing the same tune  
Looking for glory, saying I'm not part of the flock  
can't all be leaders, can't all go all out  
Inside the room now, dark and heavy   
Crowd around the bar, first glass getting  
Light in the eye, the music so loud  
Early right now, you can still hear the crowd  
But as the DJ ascends, to the turntable throne  
the bass swells up, the dancers mark out their zone  
Their thin frame leaning, their hula swinging around  
glowing in the dark, the balls of light blaze sound  
Rapid fire bass beats, the jungle kicks in  
hopping and jumping, face split into grin  
the thrill of the chase for those playing the game  
is more than enough, to get the hearts racing again  
couples forming, some shifting over the night  
not staying for one meal, multiple lovers in sight  
lost in the crowd, some stand still and confused  
not sure how to partake of this human food  
More than enough of every emotion to go around  
those lost in their heads, and those lost in the sound
