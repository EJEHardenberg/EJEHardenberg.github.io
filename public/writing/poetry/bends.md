only one name rested on lips  
ethereal moments, lucid fingertips  
touching together for a moment in time  
desiring once more your rythm and rhyme  
pairwise together our bodies hum  
the tune of joy for two hearts won  
blink away the dark and the dream ends  
alone in the silence soothing the bends
