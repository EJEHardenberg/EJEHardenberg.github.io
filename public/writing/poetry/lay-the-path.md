Brick by brick, life's path do we lay  
toiling and troubling through ruts every day  
we struggle and fight just for one simple brick  
into ditches we fall, in darkness we stray  
  
But whom can follow a road without light?  
Why walk into shadow towards eternal night?  
A lamp overhead which only needs just a word  
accept the help, let the flame burn  
  
With stone fired hot, clay mixes with gold  
a path upwards is revealed, solid road is forged  
no longer by blinded eyesight is path laid  
but a firm hand guides us and always makes a way  
  
Like parents to a child, correction is stern  
Not always within our reason, hard lessons to learn  
Persist! Do not worry. Get up again and again  
Today's setback another reason to get closer to Him.
