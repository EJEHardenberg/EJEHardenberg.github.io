Meet them yourself, an empathetic request  
But in return just a blanket address  
Disregarding good and narrow on the evil  
But movements are made of _all_ their people  

The same talking point, over and over  
How long will you carry this chip on your shoulder?  
Fight the policy, fight with your words  
But never attack the person who mourns  

The loss of their pride, the dignity gone  
What they stood for once, torn down along  
The shackles they broke and the power played  
Down what they stood for, but it's broken the same  

Lift them up, these enemies you see  
An ally for you, a fellow human in need  
Calculated cost, and theoretical plans  
But the joy can be shared, just shake their hands
