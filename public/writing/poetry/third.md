Watching the smiles and affectionate touch  
With no shame or worry they show their love  
Holding hands, hugging, kissing the palm  
watching the movie next to a single calm  
man tries to ignore and laugh in the moment  
inside growing the loneliness rockets  
after goodbye they door closing behind them    
to bed and collapsed the nightmares find him
