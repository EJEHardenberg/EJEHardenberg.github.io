Red seats are empty now, not one soul left in here  
The shells across the floor, the ones who died in fear  
There's crimson on the tarmac, streaked where bodies were dragged  
Their faces are down in dust, no time for a bodybag  
The siren is in the distance, the police lines won't be crossed  
Crack down even harder, but what good does it do the lost  

Family into mourning, a black veil for the bereaved  
Looking out for an answer, but too blind to see  
Demand for this solution, what is now to be done  
give into paranoia? forego liberty for nationalist law?  
Strike back and raise your arm, fist in the air  
raid and bomb the _others_, hell to pay, now all is fair
