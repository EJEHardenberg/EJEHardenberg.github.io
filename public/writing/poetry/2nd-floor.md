Red seats are empty now, not one soul left in here
The shells across the floor, the ones who died in fear  
There's crimson on the tarmac, streaked where bodies were dragged  
Their faces are down in dust, no time for a bodybag  
The siren is in the distance, the police lines won't be crossed  
Crack down even harder, but what good does it do the lost  
Family into mourning, a black veil for the bereaved  
Looking out for an answer, but too blind to see  
Demand for this solution, what is now to be done  
give into paranoia? divisive


They've all left now, next to the body not even a spouse  
Smeared across the floor, these people who've died  
The red of the carpet and the red of the tide
