80s came in like a fresh hit song  
Up the charts, the crimewave was peaking strong  
With over a million processed and charged   
It wasn't too long before prisons enlarged  
No one to stop it, too busy being consumed  
By material wealth and eyes to tv glued  
The populist vote, the junkies toke  
Rounding up the families who've done nothing but smoked  
Crack cocaine and the thugs that are selling it  
Living life like the rich with out any of the benefit  
18 to 1, CBC enforced, the Reagon war striking at the worst   
Dealers and leaches, the methamphetamine preachers  
Faith of the dead, and the asylum seakers  
Trafficking the powder in nonstop  
Cartel selling cake: get it while it's hot
