Void and cool this spot in bed  
absent here but not my head  
Awake in morning mourning my heart  
beats still another day to kill  
free to say, free to write, 
shackled thoughts betray what's wrought  
Pull me out from what I've entered  
spoken now, chained to candor  
mind amess with all their banter  
If untrue, pull me from here  
I'm trusting you, [missed], loved one
