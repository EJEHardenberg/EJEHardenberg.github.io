Sleep when you're dead  
But not in a stagnant room  
with no air moving and too much gloom  
Thought you'd get to bed early?  
Tonight's not the night to try   
But strip down and drink up  
"It's cooler now" you lie  
Pray for a breeze, or a touch of rain  
Anything to start the dreams again  
Awake for a few hours now  
Tossing between pillows and sheets  
Man, I'd love to get back to sleep
