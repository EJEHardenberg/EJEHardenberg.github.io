A child like a rat is drowned on the ground  
Mc'e'D's arches over head got that quarter pound  
That you need, feed on, lost in greed  
While those war torn people starve and bleed  
  
Gotta open those gates but check the reform  
Big eye lookin' for that extremist in horde  
But they slash the budget that'd give security  
While raising the ceiling for that militant majority  
  
A calculated risk, a political play  
Welfare programs for all who obey  
Leaving the bombed out market ruined in  Douma  
To meet 6000 guns, Croatia keepin' order  
  
A crisis, epidemic, you use any term  
For the 4 years of turmoil of a country burned  
By it's leaders, terrorists, thousands surround it all  
Drop the barrel bomb, citizens collateral  
  
It's not hidden, censored, just given raw  
The bodies piled up, like a punch to the jaw  
While the people are out and living in tents  
Rivers of blood flow from victims innocent  
  
How long will it be before it reforms  
This religion of peace crusading holy war  
Rejection of the west, denial of progress  
Good eggs soured by the raging jihadist
