Waving goodbye until sight no longer   
Turn away now and no pause to ponder  
Misted and hazed fumble your key  
can't stop to stop, don't want to freeze  
Burning away: life sinking in too fast    
Wipe the dishes, clean, mindless tasks  
When no other chore to do no other way  
The mirror look and see lines on the face  
Hit the wall, cry, so out of character  
But whom plays the play we're not literature  
Real life. Not false is what I have had  
What I want back, what I need, what's driven me mad  
mad for the touch and mad for the kiss  
is there something I could have done so we wouldn't miss?  
No blame must I do, no thought of guilt heavy   
Sit on the bed and listen. Music uplifting.   
Words in my head and none coming now   
Write poetry? narrative? can't when thoughts so loud
