Faking and feigning this interest for you  
Started for amusement, now look how it grew  
Devoted and caring, aren't you ever so kind  
But my smile is fading, not what I had in mind  
So how do we end this promiscuous affair?  
Burn down these bridges, or try clearing the air?  
What is there to say except that you went too deep  
It's not my problem, I won't lose any sleep
