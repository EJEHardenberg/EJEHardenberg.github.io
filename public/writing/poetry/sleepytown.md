Watching the bubbles swirl down the drain  
Fresh mint between my lips  
Washing away the heavy head and pain  
Bitter wind and a cold embrace  
Aware of this heated air passing by  
Burning out at both ends of the roll  
Similar, you and I   
The ghosts of this town leaving their marks    
Chilled down and heading home  
Not so bad outside of that deserted room   
No heart and no purpose without stillness   
Not so bad always being alone.
