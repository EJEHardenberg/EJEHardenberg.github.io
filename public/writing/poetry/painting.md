20 Artists painted the background in their blood  
Political agenda sending it straight to the hub  
More than a decade and fewer than 10  
the cost to the nation, the message to send  
Push through the laws, repress the parliament  
Your foundation standing on just 9 incidents  
Every day growing, this discriminatory affection  
To label, to lawless, to root out the infection  
A western future standing amidst a roar of blame  
The face in the mirror, you look, the same.
