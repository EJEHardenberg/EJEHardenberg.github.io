Looking for approval  
Is that why I do  
All the inane updates   
That I've sent to you  

Or is it a call out  
A question of care  
Pushing up the daisies  
Into old love affairs  

Perhaps it's the cry  
Of a masochistic soul  
Spending a summer night  
Wishing for more  

Maybe the feeling   
Is well worth the risk  
To gamble on patience  
And land with the chips
