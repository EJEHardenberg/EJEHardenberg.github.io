Can you say you're in the land of the free  
If liberties are caught up, snatched up, squeezed?  
How can you stand with your head so high?  
Ignorant bliss, to the prying five eyes  
It's been going on long before Bush  
Don't need a warrant or to ask a judge first  
You've got an executive order to share it all  
Twelve triple three working real hard to become law  
Anger only at one side of the fence  
But your current prez too, he's not on defense  
They do the same thing, both parties in charge  
Absolute power, unchecked and at large
