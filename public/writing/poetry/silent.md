It is the silent acts that speak volumes  
The nod of the head, the tip of the hat, the songs unsung  
caring for others and nurturing, giving out calls to kindness in arms  
Note each day and note each passing  
never know when stranger things will happen  
Expect the unforseen and cherish each loss  
as much as each win, there will always be more battles to be fought
