The arc blazing the sky with 80000 dollars  
Let loose by the man who'll be stiffing collars  
Bearing down on the others with even less to give  
Casually coasting onto them from beyond the ridge  

Letting loose from the world's largest defense  
Greater good for who? For the banks dividends?  
A proxy for hypocrisies sake  
What's to cost for the people to awake  

A voice of a nation sitting silent and dull  
Sensational bait hooking care into lull  
Sleep soundly away without giving a care  
no matter the death toll, in war, all's fair.
