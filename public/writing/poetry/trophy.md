Lift the trophy, working for glory  
Each rep to the chest, your time invest  
Up then down your arms aching now  
But no smoke to the eye, goal in sight  

The rigor, the pain, your body's rhythmic gain  
Push up to the clouds, arms reaching out  
Meditated in this, mind focused and crisp  
The beat of the heart, pulse still far apart  

Crunch time and primed, it's all in the mind  
Motivation to strive, the edge to win the prize  
You're doing it for you, it's why you follow through  
Don't give up on your time, you're at the finish line
