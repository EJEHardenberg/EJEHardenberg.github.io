Living close even while so far away  
Heart going out to visit each soul  
Truly a friend on even the darkest day  
With you I never hunger, I am full  
Bread that lives and wine red with blood  
Taken into me while filled with your love  
Though I stumble and even turn aside  
You smile, beckon me close, and I'm alive
