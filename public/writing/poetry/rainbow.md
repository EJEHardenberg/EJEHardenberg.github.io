Flag wailing in the wind, paint streaked up again  
Marching down the street with a purpose in hand.  

Yeah, they be walking on the streets with a claim.  
"Treat us as people", like we're one and the same  
Sex couples living together but without the right  
To hold hands while doc's turning off the light  
Upstairs in the halls they're tripping.  
Over the legalize billshit they're always spilling,  
Takes a court too long to grant the obvious  
That equal rights belong to all of us  
We find this self evident, that all men are created equalâ€”  
Except when they're not, the crime of the people  
Too rich to care, too disconnected too  
From the world they live in, when you've got that silver spoon  
Trump it up to chance, to good business sense  
It's the votes of the people, watered down in trance  
Fed up with the fed and that elitist policy  
Trickle down economics got nothing on honesty
