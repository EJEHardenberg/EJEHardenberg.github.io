What is right and what is wanted not always the same  
Head over heels or head over heart, a choice must be made  
Do you stand to your values and value your worth?  
Do you fight yourself for desire, set happiness course?  
Selfish and shameless do you take the forgetful path  
or self loathing and blameless undertake your own wrath?  
What stands to reason is not always a reason  
to fall, to fail, to contemplate treason  
do not burn my bridges while my dropbridge down  
forever left open, inside no king or queen crowned
