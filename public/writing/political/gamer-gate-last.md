### My final thoughts on #GamerGate

I've been meaning to write an update to my ongoing blogging about
\#GamerGate for a while now, probably at least 3 or so weeks. A lot has
happened, and I've done a lot thinking on this. As usual, my disclaimers
apply: 

- I am not a journalist
- I play video games
- I'm white and biologically male

#### Question everything. Trust, but verify. 

One of the largest resounding principle that has been repeated to death
by those supporting and pushing #GamerGate is the notion of having firm
evidence to back up claims. If a media, any media, is to report on a
subject with any [sincerity], they must have irrefutable proof of their
claims. This demand for sources, researched pieces is hardly something
that should even be discussed, let alone have to be [demanded] of any
outlet which calls itself a source of news. 

For those critical of this demand, who might say: "[who cares about
gaming journalism]"? **I do**. Who are **you** to say what I, or anyone
else should or should not care about? Also, gaming journalism is a
career for many people, I'd bet that they care about it. I'd bet those
who sink billions of dollars into the sites that run and produce content
care about it. If a game receives no coverage than how will the
companies who produce it make money? If a media has the ability to
[influence bonuses] by giving a score, then it matters. Especially if
that score is going to indicate a user's interest. Not everyone uses
"Let's play" videos or gameplay footage when making up which game to
buy. In other words, the sincerity of the news media when reporting has
a direct influence on a lot of people's behaviors. You would think those
who are part of that industry would care more.

You'd be [amazed] if everything you read was [well researched] and
[debated like adults] in the media. Incidents like [dorito gate and
Gerstmann-gate] would likely happen far less often. If the press did
thorough analysis as [the standards say they should] then we'd likely
all be on the same page, or at least be able to debate intelligently
about these types of things without resorting to ad hominem attacks. 

Within the #GamerGate community, whenever somethings happens, the words
trust but verify appear, sources are requested, and once these things
are settled and people have reasonable cause to accept a fact as a fact,
the information can be used. Taking a look at [gitgud's timeline] you
can see the information which the members of that group have decided
fair to put out. 

It is not always easy. Asking for evidence can often be misconstrued as a
personal attack on the persons character. When someone says: "I was
attacked" as [RevueMage] claimed, there must be a way to verify this
before accepting. In addition, context matters as well. Were they
attacked because of something personal or something related to
political stances and views? Of course safety of any potential victim
should come first, but if one makes a claim, then it is up to them to
provide evidence. And without actual evidence, those claims should not
be spread, or if they are, they should be spread with a disclaimer. 

#### Labeled as a harasser 

This is really what prompted my third, and hopefully final, writing on
\#GamerGate. [This techraptor article] details the information about the
blocklist. In short, an individual created a list of people to block
based on if you were following large voices in the #GamerGate debate.
This wasn't any cause for alarm at the time, it was a list used by a few
perhaps, and wasn't widely known. In fact, the only thing it did to me
at the time was to change my twitter handle to include "my number" on
the list (#4448 to be precise). I was placed on the list simply because I
happened to be following the "wrong people". 

However, when the IGDA, (the international game developers association)
placed this blocking tool and list on their website they labeled me:
[one of the worst offenders] in online harassment. To state that a list
of nearly 10,000 people are the worst offenders of online harassment is
not only ridiculous, it is darn right harmful to every individual on the
list. If it truly were a list of actual trolls and harassers, then it
would be a resource as the IGDA claims, however in actuality it is a
list of innocent people caught in the crossfire of one programmers bias
and ignorant and foolish idea of guilt by association. 

The IGDA has removed the list, however the damage has already been done.
The internet does not forget, any thorough investigation for a job
interview will likely show these types of things in a background search.
And in fact, [many developers] reacted strongly to the list, and the
chairman of [IGDA's Puerto Rico] branch was on the list and he
threatened to resign. Despite the disclaimer about the IGDA not
endorsing the list, this is in fact what they did by having it on their
site in the first place. And no disclaimer alleviates you from being
held accountable for creating a potential blacklist. Especially when
[you had your "fingers in it"]. 

If being told I was scum by the Gamers are Dead articles weren't enough,
now I'm apparently a harasser. Quite frankly, my only response besides
disbelief at the complete absurdity, is a large middle finger directed
towards the creators and endorsers of the tool. The tool has a whitelist
and an appeals google group. However in this country, last I checked,
you are [innocent until proven otherwise]. And my first [thought] on the
matter was this scene: 

<iframe width="560" height="315"
src="//www.youtube.com/embed/i-dJPoSlPfU" frameborder="0"
allowfullscreen></iframe>

I think we can all agree that it's ridiculous. 

#### The Facts 

Fact: [GoodGamers.us just updated their ethics policy], do you think
they had a reason for that?  
Fact: [IGN announced a policy disclosure coming soon].  
Fact: [The escapist revised their ethics policies] (This includes all of DEFY's media as well).    
Fact: [Destructoid updated their disclosure policies].   
Fact: [Kotaku now requires writers to not donate to anything they cover via patreon or any other donation platform]     
Fact: [Polygon requires the same as kotaku, disclosure of patreon/kickstarter donations from writers]   
Fact: [The FTC plans to issue revised disclosure guidelines for affiliate links and youtubers]   
Fact: [At this time the GameJobsBot uses the blocklist as a blacklist]   
Fact: [The issues raised by #GamerGate operation UV are being addressed by the FTC]   

Now let me ask any naysayers out there. Do you really want to make that
joke where you say: "actually it's about ethics in game journalism".
Because honestly, those links up there are what we've been about **the
entire time** 

Next up on the facts list. Let's take a look into the claims of
harassment. 

Fact: The statistical analysis of the people the media has said are
being harassed by GamerGate shows that overwhelmingly, the tweets sent
to individuals are **Neutral**. [And the negative tweets sent (7% or so) are actually skewed more towards the high profile men involved]

Considering that according to [recent news and surveys] men receive more
hateful harassment online, this isn't that surprising. Also not
surprising, is that despite the media narrative that GamerGate is all
about harassment of women, it _simply_ is **not** true. No one that I
know or associate with thinks that harassment of any kind is ok. 

Fact: An ongoing study by user [the\_nimbus\_] shows that those oppose to GamerGate, 
and who view it as a harassment campaign [seem to show harassment
themselves].

This isn't that surprising considering that the media has continously
dehumanized supporters of the GamerGate hashtag in each new hit piece.
If you'd like to keep up to date, Nimbus's twitter feed is updated
everyday with new results. If you want to peer review his work and see
for yourself if his conclusions are valid, they [describes the methodology
here]. 


Fact: The GamerGate Harassment Patrol [is a thing]. People who report
trolls who threaten or release personal information about others. 


And here's a fun fact, just for kicks. Supporters of GamerGate have
rallied and funded [numerous charities]. Why? Well, do you really need a
reason to donate to the less fortunate? The mentally ill or abused? To
video games? Or even to a [Sea Lion]? The answer is no. However, when
you have a lot of people together, working together towards a goal, who
actually care about issues in the world. It shouldn't be a surprise that
they're willing to drop 5 dollars here or there. Especially when Gamers, as a group,
typically come from less fortunate homes, fall on the autism spectrum,
love animals, or have been victims of bullying or abuse. 

And finally, if you really want to dive into #GamerGate after seeing the
facts listed above, I'd say a good starting place is the [Dossier] on
gamergate.me, or maybe on the [wiki](wiki.gamergate.me).

#### In conclusion

In my [previous post] I talked about the end goals of GamerGate and why
I push the tag. In the post [before that] I talked a little bit about
Zoe Quinn and it was definitely a piece which I was emotional and
reactionary about. In this one I've mentioned a lot of the good that has
happened over the last 3 months. I hope to provide it as a reference
point for some to be able to grab the links out of. For a more detailed
view, I'd recommend checking out [the timeline] on GitGud.net for that.
A good group of anons, and yes, myself, contribute to that timeline. 

Does this mean that #GamerGate is over? That we can all get back to our
lives? For some, yes, seeing this shift in the industry will appease
many. For others, no, they will not rest until they see sites like
Gawker burn to the ground (figuratively).

What about for me? To be honest, I'm pretty burned out. Being active in
any type of political scandel or movement is extremely draining. My
commits to [tools] for [twitter activists] are still there. My
[extension for archiving information] is still available if you need it.  
My commits to the GitGud repositories have slowed. I'm still posting on 
twitter and trying to spread information, but I'm far less active in the IRC
channels now-a-days, despite being an operator in some. I might take a
break for a little while from all of this, but you can be sure that my
stance on this hasn't changed throughout the last 3 months of this
happening train. There is still corruption to be outed I'm sure, and
I'll dig and archive as many links as I can for the cause. 


The fight against corruption is important. Perhaps not as important
as fighting to [slow/halt climate change], or cease [FGC]. But it's
still extremely important that media be held accountable for their
actions and journalism be held to [its standards]. What the media has
done throughout this ordeal has been to perpetuate what a friend of mine
called: "A culture of fear", it is completely and totally unacceptable
behavior. I for one, am glad and thankful that gamers have stood up and
stated that this will not stand. And that the demands are having a
positive and lasting effect on the industry. 

Happy Thanksgiving.
