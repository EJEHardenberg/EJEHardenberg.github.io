### Some Issues with Bill No. 967

#### Disclaimer

Before I start in on this I just want to state up front that I am not a 
lawyer or any sort of legal consultant. Nor am I particularly well-read
in laws. What I do have, is a pedantic set of principles and the ability
to think about how the way something is written affects the interpretation
of a work. Secondly, I think that this bill is a step in the right direction; 
but I take issues with a few statements made in it. 

#### What is Bill No. 967 (AKA Affirmative Consent)

Bill No. 967 is an addition to Section 67386 of the Education code for 
California. It's primary goal is to enforce stronger standards and practices
for dealing with sexual assault on postsecondary (college) level schools.
In order to do so, it calls for funding to any institution not following
the bills outlines to be cut. This is probably the simplest and most
effective way to get any small or large institute to rapidly implement
change. Also, the bill states:

    This bill would provide that, if the Commission on State Mandates
    determines that the bill contains costs mandated by the state, 
    reimbursement for those costs shall be made pursuant to these 
    statutory provisions.

Which means if costs occur in implementing programs outlined by the bill
the university will get their money back after a bunch of forms are filled
out. (I'm estimating it's a bunch since government forms rarely are succinct)

All in all, after reading the introduction to the bill (or Legislative Counsel'
s Digest as it is headed) this sounds like a perfectly sound, reasonable
and quite good addition to the law.

#### Getting Into Details and where we run into problems

Some readers may stop after the digest, since the bill sounds great there
then we'll vote and move on. Done. But other people reading on might 
immediatley find that there is a large bias in the wording of some parts
of the law. Let me give you my interpretation of the bill as I read it,
line by line.

**Section 1a Item 1**: This bullet point is good up until the middle. The 
first half states what most people find obvious: If you say yes, then you
mean yes. And not saying no does not count. This is a great thing to have
in the bill because it makes consent more explicit. _But_, halfway through
we run into this:

    Affirmative consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity and 
    can be revoked at any time

I'm not going to pull a media and make the joke about having to say yes
every 5 minutes to consider not being a rapist, but this portion of the
bill stood out to me becuase of the _revoked at **any** time_ clause, 
this could be horribly misused by anyone trying to game the system. I 
imagine that the intent of this statement is to provide coverage for 
those who are raped and only realize it after waking up the next morning 
confused. Which is a valid case. However, if I were a terrible person 
who wanted to get back at someone I held a grudge at, one could view 
this clause as stating that I can call rape on anyone I had relations 
with, and this law section would allow that. 

Obviously this is an extreme, but so is murder and that happens literally
every day. So I view this as something that could happen. My personal hope
is that this clause will not be mis-used, but with the way the law is written
now, I don't know how one would rewrite it without being extremely verbose
or somehow putting a time limit on how long you can wait before filing a
charge of rape against someone. Because of the seriousness of the crime
it's likely impossible to rewrite it in such a way as to prevent false
charges as described, so for the safety of victims it is written in an 
overly broad manner.

**Section 1a Item 2**: The nature of this two point item shifts 
responsibility from the defendant to the accused. This makes perfect
sense in context with the rest of the bill. The item states that believing
you have consent because you're drunk doesn't work. This is a good thing,
though I did find a bit of an issue with the second bullet in Item 2:

    The accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances
    known to the accused at the time, to ascertain whether the 
    complainant affirmatively consented.

This point sounds perfectly reasonable _if_ the law then outlined what
these reasonable steps were. But it doesn't. It just says that you took
the time to get consent within the context of wherever you were doing
at the time. It is _very_ vague. We can't ask for a manual of what to do
in every circumstance, I understand this, but "reasonable" steps are 
something that is entirely up to a jury to decide. Which, given the nature
of the crime, is likely going to go the way of an alleged rape victim.
In the case of a false charge, this clause could easily be used to say that
someone didn't try hard enough to get consent, and therefore is a rapist. 
Because of American culture, we are far more likely to believe someone
stating they were raped than we are someone defending themselves from it. 
Luckily, the second part of that sentence (`in the circumstances...`) can
be used by a defending lawyer to argue on the same vague level as the
first part. So really it will come down to whether or not a jury will be 
impartial and listen to both sides before coming to a conclusion. 

**Section 1a Item 3**: Simply put, this states that we must have a standard
in determining if the evidence at hand justifies a charge of rape or not. 
I had trouble with this section simply because it is worded so heavily
in "legalese":

    A policy that the standard used in determining whether the elements
    of the complaint against the accused have been demonstrated is the
    preponderance of the evidence.
