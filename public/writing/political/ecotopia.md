### A Book Review - Ecotopia

After writing a [small thought about civilization down] my friend gave me
a recommendation to pick up the book Ecotopia. Counter to 1984, this
book is supposed to be utopian novel, so I was interested in reading it.
Since -topian novels always seem to spark interesting thoughts or ideas,
I decided that I'd write this post down as I read it. 

After reading around 75 pages or so I could hardly contain myself
anymore. The main character of this story, Weston, is an asshole. 

Weston is an emotionally crippled American journalist who can't fathom
the notion of an independent woman. From reading, my guess's is that
Ecotopia and America split from each other around the 70's or 80's.
The leaders of the ecotopian party were women, or as Weston refers to
them: _"Those damned women"_. He's nationalistic, curious, prideful, and
completely inept at relationships. 

My first taste of not liking the character was on pg 10: 

<blockquote>
"And their manners are even more unsettling. On the streeets there are
electrical moments when woman stare me directory in the eyes"
</blockquote>

Which immediately made me think of [Norah Vincent's commentary on eye
contact]. Where she describes holding the gaze to be a show of dominance
and looking away to be submissive. It turned me off from
his character that he seemed... offended by the notion that a woman
might hold his gaze. His continued commentary on wanting to have sex and
being confused by his flirting not working on Ecotopian women was
cringe-worthy. Even when he has relations with Marissa, a lumberjack,
the polygamous nature of Ecotopian society rends him with jealously and
anger since she doesn't belong solely to him. Considering his loose
relationship with Francine back in America, it seems hypocritical of him
to get so worked up about events such as Marissa's lover in the lumber
camp and the warrior after watching the Ritual War Games. 

Another stereotype of American's is shown, the lack of ability to stay
still, the need to have business, and the way that Weston reacts to
silence:

<blockquote>
"The drabness of the countryside was increased by its evident isolation.
The roads were narrow and winding, with trees dangerously close to the
pavement. No traffic at all seemed to be moving on them. There wasn't a
billboard in sight, and not a gas station or telephone booth. It would
not be reassuring to be caught in such a region after dark."
</blockquote>

The Ecotopians he meet often laugh at his detachment to where his food
comes from. When he views a hunting party bring back a deer, he is
aghast and startled when one of the hunters smeers blood on his cheek
and laughs. His repulsion to this, and many other instances of 'getting
closer to nature' adequately displays the way that many people treat
their packaged food. It reminded me of a show I saw recently, there was
someone asking for meat, and when shown a butcher's shop, was completely
disturbed that it wasn't the usual supermarket variety that they were
accustomed to. 

With 19 years between the time of the secession of Ecotopia from
America, a lot has changed. Cars are abolished, favoring bicycles and
magnetic trains for inter-urban travel. The distributed cities are small
tribes of communes working together and living in relative peace. Each
citizen doing their part (within a maximum 20 hour enforced work week)
to work, which they do in Ecotopian fashion (read leisurely), always.
Despite the decentralized nature of the villages, they are all connected
via TV stations that display completely transparent government councils
which Ecotopians can call into to ask questions about. A utopia indeed,
and a notion I imagine would not work with a population over a few tens
of thousands. 

For different parts of government there are ministries, the first that
Weston visits being the Ministry of Food. Which, unlikely as is, ends up
with him learning more about waste and sewage than it does actual
agriculture. The notions of balance and stable state are introduced at
this point into the book. Which are further elaborated on during his
talks and his meeting with the lumberjacks in charge of cutting lumber
down. Literal tree huggers make up some of these lumberjacks. And Weston
scoffs at their 'near spiritual connection' to the trees. All the while
begrudingly admitting that the system does in fact seem to be producing
results: a healthy and happy topsoil as once of them.

And this is a common theme for Weston's internal monologues. He begins
with his hard-headed American forthrightness that the savagery practiced
by the Ethiopians is absurd. Then slowly conceeds some points to them
when shown the related statistics, which, according to the Ecotopians,
take **all** the societal costs into place, not just ones pertaining to the
industry which is being developed in some way. 

While not explicitely stated, the concept of _for the greater good_ is
heavily felt throughout the speech and thoughts of the Ecotopian
citizens. To a near religious degree, each of them contends that
_de-evolving_ their society to one closer in line to that of the Native
American Indians is the path to sustained life for humanity. Balancing
nature and humanity, with humanity as the care takers of the
environment, the ultimate goal in order for all to exist within their 
stable state. And this doctrine is pushed into them from the basemost 
level. Their education system teachs skills for survival as well as 
types and differences in flora and fauna, involving hiking trips lasting 
days with their communities. Constructive criticism enables complaints 
at restaurants to be met with ridiculously cheerful results. And the 
people get along so well it reminds me of the 'Bright and Shiny' cult 
from _[Bubble Boy]_. The education system is so well done that Weston 
states that 6 year olds cite off most of the indigenous plants and their 
uses with ease. Weston is left looking like the uneducated American that 
he is when asked what his favorite tree is, and his response is: 
"Christmas Tree". 

In addition to the greater good and the education system, the scientific
community is comprised of study groups and "optimistic estimations" to
account for the various factors in each product that hits the market. If
a product does not meet the expected standards for health and
consumption, heavy social stigma towards the product via the Televisions
scattered throughout towns makes the raw market forces hammer the
producer. Resulting in the discontinuation of the product or delegation
to specialty stores if one needs it. In fact, according to the reports
given to Weston by the Assistant Minister of Food, the soda producers,
not the consumers, are responsible for degradation of health and dental
issues that plagued Ecotopian areas before the secession. 

This blame placed upon the System, rather than those who consume it,
feels prevalent throughout the book. It seems ironic that this is the
case considering the preaching of change at the individual and human
level to rebalance nature. 

This blame also feels transmitted into penalties and anger at America.
It isn't until Weston learns about the importing and exporting of goods 
within Ecotopia that he realizes that America has been cut off. Ecotopia 
imports from Japan as well as European countries, however they have closed 
borders and trade with America until Weston is allowed to come over. While 
reading, I couldn't help but think that the author has a large distate for 
American society as is and would rather be rid of it. While upholding 
Ecotopia as a utopia, he simultaneously scorns his imagined pollution 
torn America as a champion of the overworked and corrupt -- which 
produces citizens who seem distraught and barbaric to the _more natural_ 
society of Ecotopia. 

Perhaps what is confusing the most to Weston is the dependence on the
community that has become the base of all Ecotopian life. While his
America consists of the family unit, privacy, and independence from one
another, Ecotopia consists of the tribal commune, transparency in all
relationships (including sexual), and dependence on each other and
transitively, to the system in which they live. 

Despite this dependence on the ecosystem and their cult-like zeal at
maintaining it, the people of the nation are, apparently, fiercely
independent. Able to survive on their own, craft, and create a living
for themselves within each niche of their communities. Population
control has been solved, with rates declining (to cheers), by the
solution of women having absolutely control over their bodies and
abortion clinics being prevalent in all urban areas. This .3% decrease
in annual population is critiqued by Weston in one chapter. Making note
how America's population had increased by 3 _million_ during the same time
as Ecotopia's falling 17,000 through the two decades. 

This absolute control over themselves seems transmitted to the system of
government present within Ecotopia. Within the chapter about the war
games, Weston discovers that _only_ men participate in the bloody sport.
Seen as a way to release their brutal and primal urges. In
contrast, women primarily study and are elected into politics, community
organizing, and the other areas they, within ecotopia, excel in. 
Later on, Weston contradicts his established narrative of female moral 
supremacy when he notes that violent crime is commited primarily by 
elderly and women within the society, and this is blamed on their lack 
of participation in the war games. The entire political process, as 
described by Weston, is based entirely on emotions of those involved. 
And despite the need to satisfy and accomadate all parties, at each 
meeting the unwritten agenda is apparently met. His description is so 
devoid of anything familiar to any governing institution that I've seen
and expressed as so accommodating to all voices spoken that it sounds
completely fantastical and somewhat completely absurd. 

The demolition of the state and capitalistic values happened via intense
reform throughout various industries. First through applied consumer
pressure, and when that failed, through radical economic policies which
left many corporations unable to function due to the costs of
implementation. This, combined with consolidation of resources by the
then still-forming government resulted in anarchic control of factories
by their employees, which later then shifted more towards a communist
style where partnership, ownership, and employment at a factory all
meant the same things. Combined with decentralized apartheid
mini-nations. Ecotopia is an almagation of various systems. Only in a
novel could all of these different idealogies exist in the state of
harmony described.

"Victimless Crime", such as smoking marijuana, drug use, and other
similar crimes were decriminalized, while "Gentlemen Crimes" such as
collusion, corruption, or things remenescent of American buerocratic
corporations are treated more severely. Though within the chapter on
race, it is noted that being arrested is more like having an escort, as
you still continue to work each day, you're just under house arrest when
not at work. The penalty of being ripped from the social collective is
seen as harsh enough on the individual to curb the criminal's
wrongdoings, and the ability to participate in work thought to allow
integration into normal society upon release without issue.

In his chapters on education and science, his notice of project based
learning, privatized schooling, and the way that research and teacher
are divided provides more introspection. His mind comparing the computer
driven, highly individualized learning programs of America to the nature
and skill oriented education. Perhaps one of the most interesting
distinctions here was the concept of Age of Biology versus Age of
Physics. Which sums up the educational priorities in a nutshell.
Weston's continued softening tone and removal of skepticism shows as he
wonders what it'd be like if his children had been brought up Ecotopian. 

Unsurprisingly, the shift in tone of Weston's musings are vapidly
obvious. Even without his internal monologues noticing these shifts, the
very pattern of his words and thoughts change the longer he stays. The
most obvious of these is how his treatment of women change as his
relationship with Marissa grows, how his mind shifts more onto his
feelings and the world around him rather than his work, and lastly, by
the way he refers to aspects of Ecotopian society. The first time he
watches The War Games he is horrified, trying to understand each team,
and noting them as winner and loser, having no allegiance to either. By
the end of the book he slips up and says _our team_ when the lumberjacks
are off to the games, and falls even harder into it when he
_participates_ in the games themselves; ending up with a spear in the
side in the process. 

During his healing process at the hands of the nurse Linda, his inner
musings turn towards his _culture_ and the differences between that and
the one he is reporting on. Their effect on him and his treatment of
those around him, specifically women, changes drastically thoughout his
meager 7 weeks stay in the foreign land. When this time period is
mentioned I found myself surprised, since he does _a lot_ of reporting
on the subject and travels often to speak with interviewees. Within 7
weeks he makes the haphazard decision to become Marissa's mate, leave
his home country, and at the end of the book we're left with one of the
more jarring passages as he struggles to accept his desire to abandon
America. 

After his visit with the Ecotopian President, he realizes that the original goals
given to him by the United States are trees with little chance of fruit
besides improved diplomatic relations. His purpose lost, he spends days
depressed and sulking in his room. Only to be 'captured' by a few
Ecotopians who bring him to a lodge where he eventually, and
unsurprisingly, declares his love of the country and desire to stay
there. His last great American nail, uprooted by the near cultlike
kindness and comforts of the people around him. 

Upon reflection of the book, I felt like it was a very long trope. You
know the one, where the bumbling husband who can't do anything right is
chatised by his wife and eventually, only through her coaxing and care, is
able to come to the right solution. This is intwined in nearly every
interaction with Marissa that Weston has, then once again when he is
with Linda, and once again when he is with the President. While he talks
to the other men in the groups he frequents, besides the Helicopter war
story, nothing comes to mind where he _learned and changed part of
himself_ that wasn't done to him by a woman. Even his final decision to
leave America, headed by the cunning and politically savvy male
president, for Ecotopia's woman led nation comes off as a final kick to
his acceptance of the female superiority. The only reason I feel these
thoughts came to me was reflecting on what Norah Vincent wrote in her
chapter about the Monks, where she happily describes that reforming men
to free themselves of an oppressive patriarchical system is perhaps the
final step for feminism. Considering the war games allowance of male
brutality, acceptance of sexual polygamous relations with 0
repercussions, and ecotopian men's willingness to cry and discuss their
emotions,  it seems her dream has come true within Ecotopia. 

That however, is just a trope, and one which is not inherently bad.
Weston describes interactions between the sexes as "equalitarian" (was
egalitarian not a word when this book was written?). And while the
various offices of government and the other areas may not be (Weston at
one point does mention that a few men do hold high positions even in
heavily women dominated political parties), the people of Ecotopia
themselves seem to be living in an equal and happy regime. 

Ecotopia is a small book, and for a novel that size it does a huge 180
on the main characters goals, thought process, and choices by the end.
While it's not surprising anyone that he chooses to live there, it still
felt like _everything_ in Ecotopia was a product of fantasy and
completely devoid of any reality. I suppose that's why it's a Utopian
book though. After finishing and reflecting, it became clear the obvious
parallels between my own story and this one. There exists two nations,
one seen as savages and backwards, the other as technologically advanced
and always advancing at any cost. Within the book, the United States is
the advancing society, with their dry-drip shirts, advance medicine,
computerized learning systems and vast scientific superiority, Ecotopia:
the savages. While I did really dislike the main character (and his
reformation didn't fair much better personality wise in my opinion) it
was still a good book overall, and I'm curious about some of the
technology mentioned and how much could be true or is just a pipe dream. 

For example, how likely is it that stable state type ecological
processes could be achieved? What about reformations of sewage disposal
in order to create natural fertilizer? Would the restructuring of power
plants and advancements described in energy technology enable wild game
and other rejuvenating effects to occur as they did? Would it take
longer than the 20 years of secession if it did? Is it possible to
create the geo-thermal steam powered generators that were described near
the end of the book? The fields of solar panels? Could the destruction of
corrupt and destructive corporate bureaucracies through immense
restrictions and taxation result in leaps towards more sustainable and 
greener technology? There are many ideas incorporated into Ecotopias 
vision, some obviously political, some more technological, how many could 
we learn from and implement? How many would we want to? Would it take an 
actual secession to do so? The list of questions in order to achieve a 
peaceful distributed and community driven society is long, but what is 
to stop us from trying?
