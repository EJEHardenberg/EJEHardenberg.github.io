### On Protesting

#### No Voice is Too Small 

Something that many people seem to think is that for a protest to be
effective you need to have a lot of people; while that's a given that
larger numbers creates a larger stirring of the proverbial pot, you can
accomplish plenty when you have the right influence. 

For example, [when bus drivers went on strike] in vermont they were only
a few individuals, but their affect was massive. Or when [students at
Pomona College] struck out about divesting from fossil fuels. The club
organizing the protests was rather small, but they still organized and
had a large impact on the college. 

So while some groups [within the #RealNetNeutrality] campaign may be
small, they're part of an international campaign. And it is this
solidarity that is a driving force that will (I hope) have an impact on
the FCC's direction on their Net Neutrality rulings. 

For anyone who doesn't know what Net Neutrality is, [John Oliver] sums
up things in a hilarious way, and focuses on what the affect of the
rulings would be. It's worth a watch, and I imagine you'll be in stiches
by the end of it and also, hopefully, scared. 

#### A successful protest inspires change

Because _that_ is what a protest is really an attempt to do. A protest
is an attempt to bring about a change, it's an attempt, as it were to
[Win Hearts And Minds]. This can be through an appeal to someone's moral
values or good nature, but really, fear is a better motivater. A protest
says: "If you don't do something now, about this issue I'm showing you,
there will be consequences that will affect you". 

There *are* non-violent protests, or simple protests of people sitting
down. But even when these happen, if you talk to the protester's you're
likely going to hear about whatever is causing them to protest, and the
intent is to inform you, and hopefully get you to protest as well
because you believe in the message. And because *you are afraid of what
will happen if you don't*.
