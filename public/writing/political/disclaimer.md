###Thanks for reading

The views that I express on my website are my own, which are sometimes 
completely, and unintentionally misinformed. If you find yourself disagreeing
with my _view_ on something, feel free to engage in debate in the comments. 
Maybe you'll change my mind, or inspire a new writing that is more in line with
your own views. Who knows! I **try** not to be stubborn and open minded about
most things.

If you have a problem with *facts* that are referenced, or feel that some 
statistic mentioned isn't true or valid, then cite your own sources
and let me know in comments. We'll engage in a rousting debate about
credibility and sources! Then agree to agree or agree to disagree. 

Please understand that when you post in the comments you are expected
to know [how to disagree] with someone. If you don't feel like reading
Paul Graham's excellent ideas on the subject then please use this chart
as reference:

If you're hovering at the bottom of the triangle, your comment will be 
deleted because it's not constructive to an intellectual debate on whatever
the subject is. Remember, while the internet is a place you can speak your 
mind (for now), this is **my** website. And if you're insulting people
and being rude, then I'm kicking you out. It's as simple as that. If you
want complete freedom, then I suggest you take it to an anonymous imageboard.
