#### Why I picked up this book

In light of [recent events] I have increasingly been confronted with
a lot of ideals crashing. Ideals, which in my opinion, have common
ground and could easily stand together. Yet the radical few always seem
to destroy the chance of starting anew. 

Realizing that has been massively important to me. So let me say this, a
single Radical Feminist should never define your viewpoint on the
movement as a whole. It is the actions of the majority that must be
considered. Yet often it is only one bad apple that spoils the bunch.
When I was in college I was required to take two "diversity classes".
These classes were a univerity's top-down approach to solving a bottom-up
problem. To sum it up in one sentence: the teacher ruined feminism for
me. 

Fast forward 2.5 years. After discovering [Christina Hoff Sommers]
through [my support of an ethical reform in gaming journalism], I
started to pull away from my preconceived notions, watching her [videos]
showed me a feminist I had seen little of before. While I had been exposed
to a misandrist through the aforementioned class, here I was exposed
to someone using statistics and surveys to speak to me in my own terms:
rationality and logic. 

So **I walked into my local bookstore's women's studies section** for
the first time in three years and looked for one of her books. Sadly, I
didn't find one, but I did spy Norah Vincent's "Self Made Man" sitting
on the shelf. If there's such thing as fate in this world, then it
certainly sent me this book. 

One of the things my friends know about me, and to which my parents
provide increasing disapproval each year, is that I enjoy cross dressing
during halloween or conventions.

It's not always fun, being called rude things like "ladyman" from a
group of drunk girls was painful, but it was and _always_ is a worthwhile
experience, even if sometimes upsets me.  The moment Norah Vincent's book 
made it's appearance to me and I realized it was about a woman doing what 
I do sometimes, from the other side, I had to have it. 

What shared experiences would we have? Boy oh boy, I couldn't have even 
fathomed how hard this book would hit home in some places. So without 
further disgressions, let's talk about how I'm going to approach this:
