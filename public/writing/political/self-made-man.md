#### Why I picked up this book

In light of [recent events] I have increasingly been confronted with
a lot of ideals crashing. Ideals, which in my opinion, have common
ground and could easily stand together. Yet the radical few always seem
to destroy the chance of starting anew. 

Realizing that has been massively important to me. So let me say this, a
single Radical Feminist should never define your viewpoint on the
movement as a whole. It is the actions of the majority that must be
considered. Yet often it is only one bad apple that spoils the bunch.
When I was in college I was required to take two "diversity classes".
These classes were a univerity's top-down approach to solving a bottom-up
problem. To sum it up in one sentence: the teacher ruined feminism for
me. 

Fast forward 2.5 years. After discovering [Christina Hoff Sommers]
through [my support of an ethical reform in gaming journalism], I
started to pull away from my preconceived notions, watching her [videos]
showed me a feminist I had seen little of before. While I had been exposed
to a misandrist through the aforementioned class, here I was exposed
to someone using statistics and surveys to speak to me in my own terms:
rationality and logic. 

So **I walked into my local bookstore's women's studies section** for
the first time in three years and looked for one of her books. Sadly, I
didn't find one, but I did spy Norah Vincent's "Self Made Man" sitting
on the shelf. If there's such thing as fate in this world, then it
certainly sent me this book. 

One of the things my friends know about me, and to which my parents
provide increasing disapproval each year, is that I enjoy cross dressing
during halloween or conventions.

It's not always fun, being called rude things like "ladyman" from a
group of drunk girls was painful, but it was and _always_ is a worthwhile
experience, even if sometimes upsets me.  The moment Norah Vincent's book 
made it's appearance to me and I realized it was about a woman doing what 
I do sometimes, from the other side, I had to have it. 

What shared experiences would we have? Boy oh boy, I couldn't have even 
fathomed how hard this book would hit home in some places. So without 
further disgressions, let's talk about how I'm going to approach this:

#### The format of my review and thoughts 

Thoroughness is something to look for in a review of anything, so
despite how long it may make this post, I'm going to do my best to be
thorough. This means a mini review on each chapter of the book and my
reactions, agreements, disagreements, and general thoughts on each. If
you're looking for a comprehensive review then here it is:


<div id="chapter1"></div>
#### The Whys and Hows of It

The start of the book is a simple introduction to why Mrs\* Vincent
wrote the book. How her time as a child and a rough coming of age
throughout puberty and college shaped the decisions that eventually led
her to crossdress for a year and a half. Also, she discloses that the
book is not a research study on gender differences, but rather one
woman's _experience_ of a social culture of which she had never been a
part of. 

This chapter goes over a few things that I immediately related to,
learning how to use makeup to disguise oneself, binding gendered parts
(for the author: her breasts, for me: my penis), minding gender cues and
getting voice training. All of these were things I as a reader could
immediately relate to (though she had theatre help while I mainly used
youtube), and for someone who doesn't crossdress: I think they'd find it
fascinating what someone needs to do to portray themselves as someone
else, and accept the person looking at them in the mirror as someone
else. 

One of the things that struck me, that must be talked about (especially
since this is the politics blog on my site), is the section in the
beginning about eye contact. From her perspectives of both male and
female I qoute:

(Pg 2 & 3)
<blockquote>

As a woman, you couldn't walk down those streets invisibly. You were an
object of desire or at least semiprurient interest to the men who waited
there, even if you weren't pretty - that, or you were just another pussy
to be put in its place. Either way, their eyes followed you all the way
up and down the street, never wavering, asserting their dominance as a
matter of course. If you were female and you lived there, you got used
to being stared down because it happened every day and there wasn't
anything you could do about it.

<br>

But that night in drag, we walked by those same stoops and doorways and
bodegas. We walked by those same groups of men. Only this time they
didn't stare. On the contrary, when they met my eyes they looked away
immediately and concertedly and never looked back. It was astoundind,
the difference, the respec they showed me by _not_ looking at me, by
purposely not staring.

<br>

That was it. That was what had annoyed me so much about meeting their
gaze as a woman, not the desire, if that was ever there, but the
disrespect, the entitlement. It was rude, and it was meant to be rude,
and seeing those guys looking away deferentially when they thought I was
male, I could validate in retrospect the true hostility of their former
stares.
<br>

But that wasn't all there was to it. There was something more than
respect being communicated in their averted gaze, something subtler,
less direct. It was more like a disinclination to show disrespect. For
them, to look away was to decline a challenge, to adhere to a code of
behavior that kept the peace and the pecking order among male animals.
To look another male in the eye and hold his gaze is to invite conflict,
either that or accept the status quom to leave each man to his tiny
sphere of influence, the small buffer of pride and poise that surrounds
and keeps him.

</blockquote>

When I first read this I found myself very conflicted. I took offense
to her "pecking order among male animals", in it I saw a slight
inclination to view the male as subhuman, other language in the chapter
also made me feel that she saw herself as some some enlightened pinacle
of moral superiority coming to visit the savages. 

But I continued reading, and I decided to ignore anything that
immediately started to offend me and instead to look into **what** she
was saying and not **how** she was doing it. Once that position was
taken, I could follow and agree with her in many places. For example,
during my first cross-dressing experience I was catcalled and wolf
whistled at by a group of fratboys on a porch. _This amused me to no
end_ because the thrill of passing as a woman and fooling these
blowhards made me laugh. Throughout that night the difference in treatment 
by friends and strangers was _extremely_ evident to me. Some good, some 
bad. I received more looks and was noticed more by people walking down 
the street. I felt the eyes on me. And the funny thing was that many 
were women, sizing me up in what felt like a competition of some kind. 

In the same way as Mrs Vincent found a difference in treatment, so did I. 
Having cross-dressed every halloween since, I've started to build up my 
own personal experience of life through the eyes of a woman. While no way 
nearly as comprehensive as her's, I found similarity in many of her 
expressions about the pyschological affects it can have to hold two views 
on something at the same time. Wondering: would I be treated this way if 
I was X or Y? And there is definite truth in her words when she discusses 
the value of perception and your own projection. If you go into a scene 
awkward and uncomfortable, trying to make sure no one finds our you're 
not what you are trying to appear as, the cracks show, but if you assert 
yourself as being a man (in Mrs Vincent's case) and presenting that to 
the people you're talking to, then you'll see people accept you as what 
you say you are. 

This chapter even by itself, despite simply being an introductorary 12 or
something pages, is worth getting the book for. And the rest of the book 
dives far deeper into the rabbit-hole of masculinity. I'm curious what 
others think about her analysis of eye contact, it would be very interesting 
to hear both men and women's responses in the comments below.

\*<small>I say Mrs becuase there is a dedication to her wife at the
start of the book, I assume this is correct title use, but if not let me

#### Friendship, Manning up, and Closeness

The second chapter details how the author infiltrated a men's bowling league. 
An area which she found a group of men who, despite her being poor at
the sport, took her under their wing. At first, Mrs. Vincent was wary and
nervous:

<blockquote>
	My eyes blurred in panic. I didn't see anything. I remember being 
	aware only of a wave of noise and imagined distrust coming at me
	from undistinguishable faces. Probably only one or two people
	actually turned to look, but it felt as if every pair of eyes in the
	place had landed on me and stuck.
</blockquote>

However, upon meeting her teammates she is instantly welcomed and made to
feel welcome with a simple gesture:

<blockquote>
	There was something so warm and bonded in this handshake. Receiving 
	it was a rush, an instant inclusion in a camaraderie that felt very 
	old and practiced.
	<br>
	...
	<br>
	This solidarity of sex was something that feminism tried to teach us,
	and something, it now seemed to me, that men figured out and perfected 
	a long time ago. On some level men didn't need to learn or remind themselves
	that brotherhood was powerful. It was just something they seemed to know.
</blockquote>

While one of the men doesn't greet her with as much enthusiam, simpy nodding
from across the table, throughout the months at the league she observes this 
man's son being taught some of the stereotypical rules of manhood. Bob's son, Alex,
is a chatty kid who, like many children, will blather your ear off if given the
chance. During her time in the league, Mrs. Vincent observes what she percieves 
as Alex's trial and error eduction. Where the boy is "thrown to the wolves" and
taught through teasing and thickening of his skin. The irony that both the boy 
and author were going through a sort of tutorial in mandhood isn't lost, and a
good number of interesting insights are given.

Interestingly enough, Mrs. Vincent assumed the worst in these men, as they all 
represented the stereotypical white man (plumber, construction worker, etc). In
her own words:

<blockquote>
	Exposing my own prejudices, I had expected these guys to be filled with 
	virulent hatred for anyone who wasn't like them, taking their turn to kick
	the next guy down.
</blockquote>

Yet throughout the chapter she finds places again and again where these men show
their true colors, as "rock bottom utilitarians" who judged people by their actions
and not by their words.

The chapter also covers topics on humor, death, and even some political leanings. 
It was really a fascinating read, and the author draws her own perceptions, 
critiquing the macho culture around her in a way only a woman could. Despite my
feelings that she had a bit of confirmation bias, her views and opinions were
often fresh and interesting. Her lense of the world of these men's men gave me a
good deal of food for thought. Perhaps the thing that kept me engrossed in 
reading was her praise of the nurturing and educational methods of the various 
men around her.

<blockquote>
	They took me under their wings. Another older bowler had done this. Taking me
	aside between rounds, he tried to teach me a few things to improve my game.
	This was male mentor stuff all the way. He treated me like a son, guiding
	me with firm encouragement and solid advice, an older man lending a younger
	man his expertise.
	<br>
	This was commonplace. During the course of the bowling season, which lasted
	nine months, a lot of men from the other teams tried to give me tips on my game.
</blockquote>

Mrs. Vincent finds herself in a masculine dominated area for nine months, and 
becomes friends with the members of her team. One in particular, Jim, she grows 
close to and reveals herself as a woman to him first. Opposite to her expections,
Jim and the rest of the crew aren't bothered at all. And after revealing herself
to them, they continue to be her friends and treat her just the same. Not just as 
"one of the guys", but as a friend. In Norah's words:

<blockquote>
	They made me look ridiculous to myself and they made me laugh about it. And
	for that I will always be grateful to them, because anybody who does that 
	for you is a true and great friend.
</blockquote>
