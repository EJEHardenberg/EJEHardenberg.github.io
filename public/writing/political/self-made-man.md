#### Why I picked up this book

In light of [recent events] I have increasingly been confronted with
a lot of ideals crashing. Ideals, which in my opinion, have common
ground and could easily stand together. Yet the radical few always seem
to destroy the chance of starting anew. 

Realizing that has been massively important to me. So let me say this, a
single Radical Feminist should never define your viewpoint on the
movement as a whole. It is the actions of the majority that must be
considered. Yet often it is only one bad apple that spoils the bunch.
When I was in college I was required to take two "diversity classes".
These classes were a univerity's top-down approach to solving a bottom-up
problem. To sum it up in one sentence: the teacher ruined feminism for
me. 

Fast forward 2.5 years. After discovering [Christina Hoff Sommers]
through [my support of an ethical reform in gaming journalism], I
started to pull away from my preconceived notions, watching her [videos]
showed me a feminist I had seen little of before. While I had been exposed
to a misandrist through the aforementioned class, here I was exposed
to someone using statistics and surveys to speak to me in my own terms:
rationality and logic. 

So **I walked into my local bookstore's women's studies section** for
the first time in three years and looked for one of her books. Sadly, I
didn't find one, but I did spy Norah Vincent's "Self Made Man" sitting
on the shelf. If there's such thing as fate in this world, then it
certainly sent me this book. 

One of the things my friends know about me, and to which my parents
provide increasing disapproval each year, is that I enjoy cross dressing
during halloween or conventions.

It's not always fun, being called rude things like "ladyman" from a
group of drunk girls was painful, but it was and _always_ is a worthwhile
experience, even if sometimes upsets me.  The moment Norah Vincent's book 
made it's appearance to me and I realized it was about a woman doing what 
I do sometimes, from the other side, I had to have it. 

What shared experiences would we have? Boy oh boy, I couldn't have even 
fathomed how hard this book would hit home in some places. So without 
further disgressions, let's talk about how I'm going to approach this:

#### The format of my review and thoughts 

Thoroughness is something to look for in a review of anything, so
despite how long it may make this post, I'm going to do my best to be
thorough. This means a mini review on each chapter of the book and my
reactions, agreements, disagreements, and general thoughts on each. If
you're looking for a comprehensive review then here it is:

#### The Whys and Hows of It

The start of the book is a simple introduction to why Mrs\* Vincent
wrote the book. How her time as a child and a rough coming of age
throughout puberty and college shaped the decisions that eventually led
her to crossdress for a year and a half. Also, she discloses that the
book is not a research study on gender differences, but rather one
woman's _experience_ of a social culture of which she had never been a
part of. 

This chapter goes over a few things that I immediately related to,
learning how to use makeup to disguise oneself, binding gendered parts
(for the author: her breasts, for me: my penis), minding gender cues and
getting voice training. All of these were things I as a reader could
immediately relate to (though she had theatre help while I mainly used
youtube), and for someone who doesn't crossdress: I think they'd find it
fascinating what someone needs to do to portray themselves as someone
else, and accept the person looking at them in the mirror as someone
else. 

One of the things that struck me, that must be talked about (especially
since this is the politics blog on my site), is the section in the
beginning about eye contact. From her perspectives of both male and
female I qoute:

start of the book, I assume this is correct title use, but if not let me
