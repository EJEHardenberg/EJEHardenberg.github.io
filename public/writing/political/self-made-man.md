#### Why I picked up this book

In light of [recent events] I have increasingly been confronted with
a lot of ideals crashing. Ideals, which in my opinion, have common
ground and could easily stand together. Yet the radical few always seem
to destroy the chance of starting anew. 

Realizing that has been massively important to me. So let me say this, a
single Radical Feminist should never define your viewpoint on the
movement as a whole. It is the actions of the majority that must be
considered. Yet often it is only one bad apple that spoils the bunch.
When I was in college I was required to take two "diversity classes".
These classes were a univerity's top-down approach to solving a bottom-up
problem. To sum it up in one sentence: the teacher ruined feminism for
me. 

Fast forward 2.5 years. After discovering [Christina Hoff Sommers]
through [my support of an ethical reform in gaming journalism], I
started to pull away from my preconceived notions, watching her [videos]
showed me a feminist I had seen little of before. While I had been exposed
to a misandrist through the aforementioned class, here I was exposed
to someone using statistics and surveys to speak to me in my own terms:
rationality and logic. 

So **I walked into my local bookstore's women's studies section** for
the first time in three years and looked for one of her books. Sadly, I
didn't find one, but I did spy Norah Vincent's "Self Made Man" sitting
on the shelf. If there's such thing as fate in this world, then it
certainly sent me this book. 

One of the things my friends know about me, and to which my parents
provide increasing disapproval each year, is that I enjoy cross dressing
during halloween or conventions.

It's not always fun, being called rude things like "ladyman" from a
group of drunk girls was painful, but it was and _always_ is a worthwhile
experience, even if sometimes upsets me.  The moment Norah Vincent's book 
made it's appearance to me and I realized it was about a woman doing what 
I do sometimes, from the other side, I had to have it. 

What shared experiences would we have? Boy oh boy, I couldn't have even 
fathomed how hard this book would hit home in some places. So without 
further disgressions, let's talk about how I'm going to approach this:

#### The format of my review and thoughts 

Thoroughness is something to look for in a review of anything, so
despite how long it may make this post, I'm going to do my best to be
thorough. This means a mini review on each chapter of the book and my
reactions, agreements, disagreements, and general thoughts on each. If
you're looking for a comprehensive review then here it is:


<div id="chapter1"></div>
#### The Whys and Hows of It

The start of the book is a simple introduction to why Mrs\* Vincent
wrote the book. How her time as a child and a rough coming of age
throughout puberty and college shaped the decisions that eventually led
her to crossdress for a year and a half. Also, she discloses that the
book is not a research study on gender differences, but rather one
woman's _experience_ of a social culture of which she had never been a
part of. 

This chapter goes over a few things that I immediately related to,
learning how to use makeup to disguise oneself, binding gendered parts
(for the author: her breasts, for me: my penis), minding gender cues and
getting voice training. All of these were things I as a reader could
immediately relate to (though she had theatre help while I mainly used
youtube), and for someone who doesn't crossdress: I think they'd find it
fascinating what someone needs to do to portray themselves as someone
else, and accept the person looking at them in the mirror as someone
else. 

One of the things that struck me, that must be talked about (especially
since this is the politics blog on my site), is the section in the
beginning about eye contact. From her perspectives of both male and
female I qoute:

(Pg 2 & 3)
<blockquote>

As a woman, you couldn't walk down those streets invisibly. You were an
object of desire or at least semiprurient interest to the men who waited
there, even if you weren't pretty - that, or you were just another pussy
to be put in its place. Either way, their eyes followed you all the way
up and down the street, never wavering, asserting their dominance as a
matter of course. If you were female and you lived there, you got used
to being stared down because it happened every day and there wasn't
anything you could do about it.

<br>

But that night in drag, we walked by those same stoops and doorways and
bodegas. We walked by those same groups of men. Only this time they
didn't stare. On the contrary, when they met my eyes they looked away
immediately and concertedly and never looked back. It was astoundind,
the difference, the respec they showed me by _not_ looking at me, by
purposely not staring.

<br>

That was it. That was what had annoyed me so much about meeting their
gaze as a woman, not the desire, if that was ever there, but the
disrespect, the entitlement. It was rude, and it was meant to be rude,
and seeing those guys looking away deferentially when they thought I was
male, I could validate in retrospect the true hostility of their former
stares.
<br>

But that wasn't all there was to it. There was something more than
respect being communicated in their averted gaze, something subtler,
less direct. It was more like a disinclination to show disrespect. For
them, to look away was to decline a challenge, to adhere to a code of
behavior that kept the peace and the pecking order among male animals.
To look another male in the eye and hold his gaze is to invite conflict,
either that or accept the status quom to leave each man to his tiny
sphere of influence, the small buffer of pride and poise that surrounds
and keeps him.

</blockquote>

When I first read this I found myself very conflicted. I took offense
to her "pecking order among male animals", in it I saw a slight
inclination to view the male as subhuman, other language in the chapter
also made me feel that she saw herself as some some enlightened pinacle
of moral superiority coming to visit the savages. 

But I continued reading, and I decided to ignore anything that
immediately started to offend me and instead to look into **what** she
was saying and not **how** she was doing it. Once that position was
taken, I could follow and agree with her in many places. For example,
during my first cross-dressing experience I was catcalled and wolf
whistled at by a group of fratboys on a porch. _This amused me to no
end_ because the thrill of passing as a woman and fooling these
blowhards made me laugh. Throughout that night the difference in treatment 
by friends and strangers was _extremely_ evident to me. Some good, some 
bad. I received more looks and was noticed more by people walking down 
the street. I felt the eyes on me. And the funny thing was that many 
were women, sizing me up in what felt like a competition of some kind. 

In the same way as Mrs Vincent found a difference in treatment, so did I. 
Having cross-dressed every halloween since, I've started to build up my 
own personal experience of life through the eyes of a woman. While no way 
nearly as comprehensive as her's, I found similarity in many of her 
expressions about the pyschological affects it can have to hold two views 
on something at the same time. Wondering: would I be treated this way if 
I was X or Y? And there is definite truth in her words when she discusses 
the value of perception and your own projection. If you go into a scene 
awkward and uncomfortable, trying to make sure no one finds our you're 
not what you are trying to appear as, the cracks show, but if you assert 
yourself as being a man (in Mrs Vincent's case) and presenting that to 
the people you're talking to, then you'll see people accept you as what 
you say you are. 

This chapter even by itself, despite simply being an introductorary 12 or
something pages, is worth getting the book for. And the rest of the book 
dives far deeper into the rabbit-hole of masculinity. I'm curious what 
others think about her analysis of eye contact, it would be very interesting 
to hear both men and women's responses in the comments below.

\*<small>I say Mrs becuase there is a dedication to her wife at the
start of the book, I assume this is correct title use, but if not let me
know in the comments below</small>
