###What does GamerGate Mean to me? 

I wrote [about the scandal] in my last post. But this time I want to
talk about something different. I want to talk about how GamerGate has
affected me personally. Also, this post will try to touch on some of the
issues in it as well (no cause is without flaw).

As I did in the last post, I want to state upfront that I am biased. 

- I'm not a journalist, this is a blog not a news site
- I'm white and biologically male
- I go on 4chan semi-frequently and enjoy the culture
- I love playing Video Games

I absolutely love IRC channels, when I first learned about [Harp] I went
into their IRC channel and began part of their community. I don't go in
as much as I used to, but I still actively blog on my [tech blog] about
using it. The #burgersandfries community is a group of random people,
over 300, that come from different countries, communities, race, gender,
and walks of life. But we're all banded together in a single united
cause. 

That cause is #GamerGate. Asking someone what GamerGate means to them is
like asking a feminist what feminism means to them. You're going to get
different statements. In the same way that feminism is composed of a
group of people who share a collected voice around the ideal of
equality, GamerGate is a consumer revolt shared around the idea of
integrity.

But let me hold off on that, we're talking about the community here. One
of the things that binds every one of us together is that we're gamers.
And while the [media may claim we're dead], we're very much alive and
well. Because all it takes to be a gamer is to play video games. So how
could we _die_ if there's still such thing as gaming media/journalism?
You can't have an industry without consumers. 

Twitter, something I didn't use much before all of this, has become a
massive voice to me. I've made friends with various members of the chat
and followed them. In my mind, together we form a sort of microphone for
each others voices. In the same way that people who don't agree with
\#GamerGate boost each other's opinions, we do the same. We share links,
articles, and come to each others aid when we run out of ideas or need
help debating a topic. To draw an obvious parallel, we're playing on the
same team in an FPS and actually coordinating. 

That last comment reeks of an "us vs them" mentality. This brings me to
my next point about \#burgersandfries: we actively police each other.
Some of us are (rocketman120, warning!!\*) triggered by different
things, some topics set us off on a rage and we immediately start to
lose reason and want to go on a crusade. Within the IRC, this get's
policed. All members of the IRC are reminded to keep the following in
mind:

Infographics like these are spread throughout [/v/]\*\* threads supporting
\#GamerGate, spread via twitter from people making them, and on reddit
threads as well. Infographics are a way of communicating to people who
don't want to read something that's 30 pages long. Or people who can't
be bothered to look at sources themselves. They are the most useful
propaganda\*\*\* that anyone could possibly push. Useful ones that
follow the rules about debating in the image above are actively used. 

Despite all of this, despite how active \#burgersandfries is in
promoting \#GamerGate, and providing a space for people to talk about
it, **it is not a hivemind**. The IRC channel in **no** way are
masterminds of the whole event. There's already a [great narrative and
timeline] explaining where the hashtag started. 4Chan didn't start it,
but the gamers within 4chan and a lot of other websites definitely
rallied around it.
