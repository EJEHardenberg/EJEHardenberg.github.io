###Freedom of Speech vs HateSpeech

<strong>
Disclaimer: I am discussing FreeSpeech only.
</strong>

I'm sure you've heard this before on the internet: "Free speech man! I
can say what I want!". You may have shaken your head and walked away,
you also may have started to respond and argue on the internet. And,
well, [we all know how well that works]. 

Whatever this internet troll has said, the fact is that they are almost
always correct about their right to Free speech. It does not matter if
you are offended. I'm sorry, but it doesn't. If something as simple as
being offended by something someone else has said (which is very easy)
constituted a violation of the First Amendment, then we'd all be jailed
by some thin-skinned person with a lawyer. And while I don't always
enjoy seeing things that offend me, I am fully aware that people can
voice their own opinion, so long as it is simply voicing it. 

Where you step into the areas outside of your rights is when your
words become a call to action that can harm someone. The Supreme Court
only counts speech as hateful if it leads to "imminent violence". For
example, in the case of Synder v. Phelps in 2011, the Westboro Baptist
Church (WBC) was protesting with signs that offended people (myself included),
it was brought to court and you know what? The Supreme Court sided with
Phelps, the head of the WBC. Protecting their
constitutional right to say the things they did regardless of whom they
offended. This decision was made because the WBC was not promoting any
sort of imminent violence. 

The funny quip you may hear in a cartoon or western is somebody calling
out to another that "them's be fighting words!". Oddly enough, this is
actually one of the first things which Freedom of Speech does _not_
protect. Fighting words are inflammatory speech designed to cause the
hearer to retaliate back, typically in a physical manner or in some way
that would be injurious to themselves. For example, if you walk into a
black neighborhood and start calling them all derogatory terms, not only
are you likely a racist, but you're inciting them to attack you.
Fighting words in the truest sense. In that case, you are not protected
by a Freedom of Speech for being a bigot, and are engaging in Hate
Speech.\[1\]

Besides fighting words, threats, child pornography, obscenity,
defamation, invasion of privacy and intentional emotional distress all
fall into the category of exclusions of Freedom of Speech. Let me give
an example of each I suppose: 

- **Threats**: this is obvious, if I say I will kill you, that is not
  protected by the 1st amendment as free speech. 
- **C.P**: I feel this is obvious, but you cannot post, NOR distribute even
  inadvertently any depiction of such things. 
- **Obscenity**: If you send George Bush a shopped image of him having sex
  with a rabbit or something, that's not gonna be protected.
- **Defamation**: Check out 'The People vs Larry Flyny', you can't slander
  someones name. And need to check the malice standard (established in
  'New York Times v Sullivan'.
- **Invasion of Privacy**: on the internet this means "doxxing" someone, or
  releasing _non-public_ information about where they live, their phone
  number, or any other personal information related. 
- **Intentional Emotional Distress**: If you know someone who was raped,
  then send them rape imagery, fanfiction of rape fantasys, or anything
  of that nature which would bring up the traumatizing experience, that's
  not within the realm of protected speech. Same for if you threw
  firecrackers near a war veteran with PTSD.

Another example of fighting words is calling any sort of cultural
identity dead and dehumanizing said culture. A la \#GamerGate. But I
digress since this piece is not about \#GamerGate.
