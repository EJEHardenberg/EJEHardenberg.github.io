Trying out Soylent
-------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1:

Initial thoughts:

Reading all those blogs and anecdotes about it, specifically [1] 
prepared me pretty well. I was lucky enough to get an emersion blender
for free this week and so my drink is very smooth. I got the powder
version of v1.5. The smell reminds me like flour. And the taste is like
soy, but creamy like milk at the same time. I can feel a little grit
texture wise, but oddly enough it doesn't linger in my mouth with any
bad after taste. It goes down smoothly and my initial thought, like many
others I think, is: "Huh, better than expected".
