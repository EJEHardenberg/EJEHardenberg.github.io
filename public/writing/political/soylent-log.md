Trying out Soylent

### Wait What?

Soylent is the brain child of [this guy] who made some splashes when he 
decided to ["stop eating food"]. It's designed to be a meal replacement 
for one, two, or all of your meals as you like it. With the original 
intent of saving time for the busy, and making a healthy alternative to 
other inexpensive food, it's pretty neat. I was intrigued when I read 
the original blog posts and then decided to try it myself after reading 
[this blog post about it]. I figure'd that I'd keep a sort of log about 
it to offer my opinion to anyone else who finds this page. I'm not going 
to focus on the quality of writing, and this is more of a stream of 
consciousness than anything else:

### Day 1:

Initial thoughts:

Reading all those blogs and anecdotes about it, specifically the fourhourworkweek
post prepared me pretty well. I was lucky enough to get an emersion blender
for free this week and so my drink is pretty smooth. I got the powder
version of v1.5. The smell reminds me like flour. And the taste is like
soy, but creamy like milk at the same time. I can feel a little grit
texture wise, but oddly enough it doesn't linger in my mouth with any
bad after taste. It goes down smoothly and my initial thought, like many
others I think, is: "Huh, better than expected".

### Day 2:

Only had a little bit this morning because I had to travel out of state
and didn't want to lug a large pitcher with me. But the taste was still
fine, still drinking the batch I made on Day 1.

### Day 3:

Had another cup of soylent for dinner, had to work late (on a weekend)
and so I didn't actually have Soylent for lunch like I had originally
planned. I did bring a small bottle of it with me to work, but it seems 
that after a couple days keeping the drink from clumping becomes more 
difficult, and the clumps were really off putting to me. Later, at night, 
I put the remaining Soylent from lunch into my blender and it made it 
drinkable again. While at work I experimented with holding chocolate to 
my nose before drinking, it was interesting how much that changed the 
perception of the taste of soylent. Tomorrow I'll try putting strawberries 
into it. I also used my blender rather than an emersion blender and had 
better results with removing clumps. The soylent instructions say that 
2 days is typically the max for a batch before it goes rancid so I'll 
have to make a new one tomorrow.

### Day 4:

I woke up much later than I should have this morning so I didn't have 
any time to prepare Soylent for work. Once I did get home though I ran 
off to the local Co-op to buy some strawberries. I've just finished my 
dinner drink and dear Lord was this a good decision. The aversion I've 
had to the slight texture in soylent is completely gone now that I've 
mixed in the strawberries. 

I think I'm used to the gritty feeling you get when making any blended 
drink with berries, so that offsets anything in my brain that was getting 
disturbed by the slight texture left over in the soylent (which no amount 
of blending seems to remove for me). For future reference (and for anyone
reading this) I bought a quart of strawberries and pre-blended enough of 
them to fill up a 16oz cup. Then I made my soylent by pouring in half of 
a bag, adding a bit of water, then adding the other half and the rest of 
the water. After that I used my emersion blender for a bit, then shook 
the container before adding in the blended strawberries. Finally, I poured 
a cup for myself and blended that just for kicks. The result was a pretty 
smooth meal. The smell of the strawberries easily overpowers the soylent 
powdery smell and I had 0 problems drinking it. I think this is going to 
be how I make my soylent from now on.
