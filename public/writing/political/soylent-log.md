Trying out Soylent
-------------------------------------------------------------

### Wait What?

Soylent is the brain child of [this guy] who made some splashes when he 
decided to ["stop eating food"]. It's designed to be a meal replacement 
for one, two, or all of your meals as you like it. With the original 
intent of saving time for the busy, and making a healthy alternative to 
other inexpensive food, it's pretty neat. I was intrigued when I read 
the original blog posts and then decided to try it myself after reading 
[this blog post about it]. I figure'd that I'd keep a sort of log about 
it to offer my opinion to anyone else who finds this page. I'm not going 
to focus on the quality of writing, and this is more of a stream of 
consciousness than anything else:

### Day 1:

Initial thoughts:

Reading all those blogs and anecdotes about it, specifically the fourhourworkweek
post prepared me pretty well. I was lucky enough to get an emersion blender
for free this week and so my drink is pretty smooth. I got the powder
version of v1.5. The smell reminds me like flour. And the taste is like
soy, but creamy like milk at the same time. I can feel a little grit
texture wise, but oddly enough it doesn't linger in my mouth with any
bad after taste. It goes down smoothly and my initial thought, like many
others I think, is: "Huh, better than expected".

</div>

### Day 2:

Only had a little bit this morning because I had to travel out of state
and didn't want to lug a large pitcher with me. But the taste was still
fine, still drinking the batch I made on Day 1.

### Day 3:

Had another cup of soylent for dinner, had to work late (on a weekend)
and so I didn't actually have Soylent for lunch like I had originally
planned. I did bring a small bottle of it with me to work, but it seems 
that after a couple days keeping the drink from clumping becomes more 
difficult, and the clumps were really off putting to me. Later, at night, 
I put the remaining Soylent from lunch into my blender and it made it 
drinkable again. While at work I experimented with holding chocolate to 
my nose before drinking, it was interesting how much that changed the 
perception of the taste of soylent. Tomorrow I'll try putting strawberries 
into it. I also used my blender rather than an emersion blender and had 
better results with removing clumps. The soylent instructions say that 
2 days is typically the max for a batch before it goes rancid so I'll 
have to make a new one tomorrow.

### Day 4:

I woke up much later than I should have this morning so I didn't have 
any time to prepare Soylent for work. Once I did get home though I ran 
off to the local Co-op to buy some strawberries. I've just finished my 
dinner drink and dear Lord was this a good decision. The aversion I've 
had to the slight texture in soylent is completely gone now that I've 
mixed in the strawberries. 

I think I'm used to the gritty feeling you get when making any blended 
drink with berries, so that offsets anything in my brain that was getting 
disturbed by the slight texture left over in the soylent (which no amount 
of blending seems to remove for me). For future reference (and for anyone
reading this) I bought a quart of strawberries and pre-blended enough of 
them to fill up a 16oz cup. Then I made my soylent by pouring in half of 
a bag, adding a bit of water, then adding the other half and the rest of 
the water. After that I used my emersion blender for a bit, then shook 
the container before adding in the blended strawberries. Finally, I poured 
a cup for myself and blended that just for kicks. The result was a pretty 
smooth meal. The smell of the strawberries easily overpowers the soylent 
powdery smell and I had 0 problems drinking it. I think this is going to 
be how I make my soylent from now on. 

### Day 5:

Started today off by trying to find a better container for my drink,
ended up finding an old glass jar that's about the same size as the
water bottle I used yesterday. Glass = No plastic smell which is good.
The consistency of the strawberry soylent is good still, not clumpy once
I shake it in my jar. I packed a bit and took it to work. 

Ended up drinking (should I call it eating?) my meal around 12:30 or so
and it filled me up. I had to stay late in the office again though, I
would have originally been home around 6, and that was right around the
time when I was realy wanting some soylent. But I was in the office for
another 4 hours, and my boss bought Pizza for the people working late.
So sadly I had another day without being fully on Soylent like I wanted
to be. Still, when I got home I had a small cup of soylent since I
figure my breakfast and lunch couldn't have been more than 1000 calories
and my dinner of pizza at work consisted of 4 slices of thin-style pizza 
that probably was at most another 1000.

Today was definitely a change from my previous mentality though. Before
I was trying to figure out how I was going to mix it up to avoid clumps,
today I was just thinking about how good it was with the strawberries.
Tomorrow I'll bring more Soylent to work if I can find another
container, it will probably another late night and I don't want to waste
any of this batch like I did the previous.

### Day 6:

I really need to buy another glass jar or something. Ended up using my
small blender cup (16oz or so) as a second container for the Soylent I
brought to work today. It was still delicious (yay strawberries!) and I
was quite content having one cup a little after noon and the other one
sometime around 5:30. 

It was another late night at work, so I did end up eating some leftover
pizza from the previous night around 8 or 9 since I couldn't make it
back home to finish off the last of this Soylent batch. Unfortunately
since I worked so late (past midnight) I didn't get a chance to go to
the store and buy more strawberries, so I'm not sure if I'm going to be
able to make more soylent tomorrow or not! 

Still, I'm impressed again. Now that I've figure'd out how to get past
any clumping and making the neutral taste be something I like, I'm
starting to take more stock in other things. LIke whether or not I'm
hungry. So far I haven't been hungry, even when two of my meals were
replaced. I'm looking forward to the weekend so I can be sure to get a
full day of only Soylent. 

Oh, and I think my bowels have started taking notice. I won't go into
detail, but there are some differences. Nothing bad, just differences.

### Day 7:

Wow has it already been a week? End of the year madness has hit me hard.
But still, got an update on the soylent situation! This morning I poured
what remained of my soylent into a jar and brought it to work. I had it
as part of my lunch with a salad and some type of brocolli rabe. 

My flatmate was kind enough to buy me strawberries, but I didn't have
enough time in the morning to make a new batch of soylent to last me the
day (other people are asleep when I get ready for work, so I wouldn't
want to run a blender). So I'll be making that... sometime tomorrow,
probably going in late to work tomorrow since we were all in the office
until 12:30? 1? I don't know.

Anyway, an interesting observation today: I've noticed that I'm not
hungry when I drink Soylent, but when I do get "real" food (which my
boss buys because they're a nice person and helps us out when we're
working late) my stomach rumbles. Not really a problem, but found it
interesting. Once again, looking forward to this weekend when I get to
sit at home, not do anything, and enjoy a few full days of Soylent.

### Day 8:

Used the strawberries my house mate was kind of enough to buy me to make
a new batch of Soylent. Even though I forgot to use my emersion blender
on it it still turned out fine from just shaking it which is great.
Enjoyed it at work, and then again later for dinner. I had a normal
breakfast and did go out with friends to grab a drink and had a bit of
pizza, so no all soylent day yet. that will be tomorrow though. Still,
not having any problems with being hungry after substituing in Soylent
for a meal, I guess that's all the protein in it.

### Day 9:

Today was going to be my all soylent day, and I almost managed it!
Breakfast and Lunch were both a cup of strawberry soylent. But then I
watched the match between Germany & Italy, and met up with a friend, so
I ended up having a delicious steak at a restaurant. So once again, I
managed to botch up that whole idea of seeing what happens when I'm only
going off Soylent. 

Today there are no such matches though, and tomorrow is a holiday, not
today, so I should be able to do it. We'll see if I can manage, or if I
get pulled off into the world of fun activities with friends that always
seem to involve food of some kind. Not that I'm really complaining. I
think that a completely Soylent day would be fine, I mean, I've almost
done it multiple times already having a few days last week where besides
my breakfast I had just Soylent. 

I haven't really felt any downgrade to my personal self due to it,
despite having an intensely busy week where I was up late for work and
such I still felt normal and good. Whether or not that's the Soylent
kicking in with all those vitamins I don't normally get or not is
another matter though. It's hard to measure that type of thing when
you're usual schedule is thrown off. So next week should supply a better
guage of the perceived effects.

### Day 10:

So much for my plan of only having Soylent all day! Started out with
being lazy and playing video games while having my breakfast cup. But
since I sat around all day I wasn't that hungry. So I didn't bother with
lunch, and then I went out to the movies with friends and had some candy
and a soda. Afterward I had some beer and hung out with people chatting
and that was it. So I suppose the only _real_ food I had all day was the
Soylent, but I didn't have a _just_ soylent day. And tomorrow will
probably be a miss too since it's a holiday.

### Day 11:

No soylent at all today on account of it being a holiday and me being
the grill master. Provided I wake up early tomorrow though, I'll make a
batch and bring some to work for lunch.

### Day 12:

That _provided_ was the main word there. Didn't have any soylent today,
but I did make a batch for tomorrow!

### Day 13:

Back on the bus! Lunch and dinner today were soylent and it feels good 
to be back! Granted I did have friends over again today and we ended up 
running out at 10pm to get chinese food, but hey, still mostly Soylent 
today!

### Day 14

Only for lunch today, I had leftover chinese from last night so I had 
that rather than let it slowly rot away in the fridge.

### Day 15

Lunch again yesterday was Soylent. I didn't bother with dinner at all
because I was busy. Tomorrow though, I'll be making a fresh batch of
Soylent and will be trying to do an all day if I don't get pulled away
into hanging out with friends.

### Day 16 

All day of Soylent! Finally, managed to get a single day of just
eating/drinking soylent! Near dinner time I kind of felt like my body
was satisfied, but that it wasn't filled if that makes sense. Like, I
wasn't hungry, but my stomach wasn't used to not having food in it at
the same time. Soylent being mostly liquid probably has something to do
with this feeling I think. 

It brings me to wonder if someone only had Soylent, or primarily had it
as their number one source of food for all but maybe one meal per week,
would it negatively impact their stomach's size or ability to process
more solid foods? 

Curiousity aside, I'm a little bummed it took me this long to get a full
day of just soylent in. As of today I feel perfectly fine. Not tired, or
unsatisfied in anyway for that matter. I don't have any bloated feelings
I might get from over-eating or anything like that. I just kind of
feel... normal? We'll see if what I had today adversely effects
tomorrow. 

### Day 17 

Breakfast was Soylent today, but then I ended up going out with friends
for lunch, dinner was finishing off some leftovers. 

### Day 18 

Lunch today ended up being some pizza because it was a work thing, but I
finished off the last bit of my Soylent for dinner and then made a new
batch of soylent for tomorrow.

### Day 19

Soylent lunch today, but then for Dinner I was out playing puzzled pint
so I had some regular food. 

### Day 20

Soylent for lunch today, but had a friend over for dinner and games so
we ate some takeout. 

### Day 21

Soylent for lunch and dinner today! 

### Day 22

Soylent for lunch, I'm down to my last batch from my initial order.
Luckily the timing seems to have worked out all right, so my next batch
will be arriving sometime next week. In the meanwhile I'll live off of
my usual supply of pizza rolls. 

Also, a friend and I made somewhere around 70 gyoza dumplings last
night. So I have plenty of those for eating whenever I want as well.
Just because I'm partially giving up traditional food doesn't mean that
I can't still cook and enjoy making things!

### Day 23

Soylent for breakfast, but today was a weekend so we decided to do some
grilling. Did some pretty awesome stuff on the grill, burgers made from
the same filling as the gyoza turned out well. Also tried making some
random frozen food stuffs on the grill wrapped in bacon and that worked
too. Besides the grease fire. 

### Day 24 

Soylent for breakfast again, then relaxed and ate some of the groceries
I bought so that I could conserve my last bit of soylent for the work
day tomorrow. 

### Day 24

Last drink of my last batch of Soylent. Luckily my order went out
yesterday, so hopefully my new batch of v1.6 will be arriving soon. I
had v1.5 before, so this will be a change once it arrives. I just hope
it arrives soon! It's way easier to prepare a cup of soylent for lunch
at work than it is to make a sandwich or something else.

### Day 25 

No soylent :(

### Day 26

Still no soylent! I haven't experienced any slowness or things like that
that I've read described, but then again, I didn't experience any Jimmy
Neutron brainblast style stuff while on it anyway. 

### Day 27 

Box of soylent arrived! I had a work function though, so I didn't
actually need any for dinner. Still, I made my pitcher for tomorrow and
since it's the new v1.6 I poured a small amount into a cup to try it
while saving the rest for later. 

My initial thoughts on v1.6 is that it's much _much_ finer than v1.5.
And this has positives and negatives. For example, with v1.5 I was
initially put off by the thick taste at first, but once I started mixing
strawberries in it worked well for me and I started enjoying the
viscosity. With v1.6 it feels more watery, I don't know if this will
change my sense of soylent to be more of a drink than a shake. It was
very easy for me to substitute a meal with v1.5 because it was a solid
mix between liquid and, uh, solid. I wonder if tomorrow when I have v1.6 for
lunch if I'll feel just as satisfied? 

Also, the [release notes for v1.6] note that they've replaced the rice
protein entirely with soy protein instead. So the flavor has changed a
bit and the smell too. While drinking my test cup I was swirling it in
my mouth for taste and could feel the fine powder. With v1.5 I felt like
it mixed a bit better and disolved. This might go away with an overnight
sit in the fridge though, so I'll have to wait until tomorrow lunch and
dinner to really give it a go. The other thing I should probably try is
drinking v1.6 without mixing any strawberries in; the taste has changed
enough that I might be able to drink it without mixing something in,
which would save me a little bit of money. 

The smell of v1.6 is much more subdued than v1.5, oh and when I was
using my emersion blender on it it was noticeably different from v1.5.
With the older version I generally had clumps that would linger around
still until I let the drink sit for a while and then mixed again. With
v1.6 it was very smooth and I didn't see any clumping at all. I didn't
look too hard before blending, but I imagine that I might be able to get
away with just shaking this version. I'll have to experiment though.
I'll take a picture tomorrow of my drink so I can compare it to my
picture of v1.5 near the top of the log. 

### Day 28 

Soylent for lunch! Trivia tonight kind of took over dinner and whatnot,
but I had another glass of v1.6 for lunch today and am continuing to
make my opinion up about it. I read some other reviews to see if anyone 
more eloquent had come up with a description that matched my taste, but 
not much luck there. The biggest thing to me still is how smooth it is;
it's a massive difference from v1.5 to me. 

Someone on the discourse forums for soylent said "sawdust" and I kind 
of see how the texture might be like that, but it definitely doesn't 
taste like that. I'm thinking about my v1.5 now and thinking to myself 
that it didn't have the same... hm... grit to it that v1.6 has. The 
newer soylent definitely is smoother, more liquidy, and goes down 
easier. But there is a noticeable grainyness to it that fits the 
"sawdust" description. It's been a long time since I had kool-aid 
made with the powder, but I wonder if it would be similar if you had
added too much powder?

I definitely notice the addition of soy in the aftertaste though I 
saw lots of complaints about a very bitter aftertaste, to the point 
of some people gagging. But I don't know, maybe it's the strawberries 
or something but I really don't notice any aftertaste besides the 
briefest of a hint of soy that fades quickly. I think I'll definitely 
make a plain batch of Soylent next, maybe just two scoops or something 
instead of the whole bag. Then again, why mess with success?

### Day 29 

Soylent for lunch and dinner with no problems. I tried to mull my drink
over in my mouth and think more about it, but I think I summed it up
pretty well in yesterday's note. I think I found a little bit of the
bitterness, but it's still not to the same degree that others on
discourse were saying.

### Day 30

Soylent for breakfast today, but that was it since I have a friend up
visiting and we're planning on eating some of those dumplings I made
before among other things. I let him try it and he said "not bad", which
is pretty much the usual reaction. After looking at the nutritional
information he also said that he thinks it'd be good for hiking.

### Day 31

<div style="text-align: center">
	<img src="/images/soylent/2016-07-26.jpg">
</div>

Still had my friend over for a while, so it wasn't until nighttime that 
I made my newest batch of Soylent. I forewent the strawberries this time
deciding that I'd find out if v1.6 was more palatable than v1.5. I had 
already had dinner (need to use some milk before it went bad, so Mac & 
Cheese it was!), but I made the batch and tried a spoonful of the plain
Soylent. Not bad, creamy as usual, and very mild. I'll have to give a 
more thoughtful review tomorrow when I have it for lunch.

### Day 32

Lunchtime Soylent! I'm still impressed with the smoothness in case you 
can't tell. The color is the same cream, milky white-ish yellow that the
powder is. And the smell reminds me somewhat of the smell you get when 
you're mixing flour and water while baking bread... but without the yeast 
part. I had to try _really_ hard to smell my drink though. It's really a 
light smell. 

The taste is exceptionally mild, it's somewhat hard to believe that it's 
just water and powder because of how creamy it is, it reminds me of the 
consistency of milk. As far as what the heck I'm tasting is, boy, I don't 
know. I guess I'd say it tastes like Soylent, because I'm coming up blank 
on what it tastes like, kinda nut-ish? Thinking back on the whole "OMG 
IT'S SO BITTER" thing I read on the forums, I'm *not* experiencing it at all.
In fact, now that I think about it, the graininess is gone too. So I think
that I used more water (since I wasn't using the strawberries) really helped 
mix in the rest of the soylent and remove the "sawdust" texture entirely. 

I'm trying to remove some of the food I bought when I was waiting for my
new soylent, so I had "normal" food for dinner.

### Day 33 

Mixed hot chocolate mix with my Soylent today. Super good idea on my
part if I do say so myself. It was creamy, chocolately, and delicious.
Definitely going to have to do this one again, since it's just some more
powder it mixes in easily and I can keep the amount of water I've put in
to make it more creamy. 

I had regular soylent for my dinner, tasty. My friend who drinks 2.0
everynow and then and has compared the taste to soy milk. I've never had
soy milk, so I don't know if that's a good comparison or not.

### Day 34

Regular soylent for lunch again today, definitely don't have any issues
or even feel like I need strawberries for this. Which is great because
that's going to save me a good amount of money each week. Soylent for
dinner as well, though I finished my batch today so I supplemented a bit
with some pizza rolls. 

### Day 35

New batch of regular soylent again! I'm saving _a lot_ of time not having
to cut up and prepare the strawberries for my soylent. Hello more time to 
code! Yes! Nothing crazy to note for lunch, besides having a few ghost 
pepper tortilla chips that someone brought it. Super tasty, very spicy, a 
good way to round out the mild meal I had for sure. 

Was a trivia night, so I had a burger for dinner there.

### Day 36

Plain soylent again for lunch, but went to an event with a bunch of food
trucks and had a chicken sandwich for dinner. 

### Day 37

Soylent for breakfast, but ended up having dumplings for lunch (I still
have so many of them from when my housemate and I made them). Then we
chipped in together on some food for dinner for fun. I'll do my best to
have my meals be soylent tomorrow.

### Day 38

Soylent for breakfast. I really didn't do much at all today so I didn't 
really have lunch or dinner, just kind of snacked on some peanuts and a
couple leftover wings from the other day. 

### Day 39

Soylent for lunch and dinner. I've decided to trim my breakfast down as 
well, for both budget purposes and to get more soylent in so I can see 
if it has any positive effects.

### Day 40 

Trimmed out my breakfast beverage, so just had soylent today besides
going to a movie. Feeling good.

### Day 41

Soylent for lunch today, no drink again during breakfast so that's good.
And then I played trivia with people so ended up eating out instead of
having soylent for dinner.

### Day 42

Breakfast sandwich again, no beverage though. Then soylent for lunch and
I ate out with a friend again since we both had hard days.

### Day 43

Continuing my break off of breakfast beverages, so no real breakfast
today. My usual clerk noticed and got me some water instead which was
sweet of them. Soylent for lunch, and then my friend owed me dinner so I
didn't have soylent for that. Will probably have a couple leftover
breadsticks tomorrow for dinner along with my soylent.

### Day 44

Ended up going out to see Suicide Squad and had dinner before hand with
friends so I only had soylent for lunch today. Also didn't get to eat my
breadsticks yet either. Maybe I'll have those tomorrow sometime while
trying to do a full day of soylent again. I figure if I can manage a
full weekend of just Soylent then I'll treat myself to a pizza or
something on Monday.

### Day 45

For breakfast I finished off those leftover breadsticks, and then lunch
and dinner was Soylent. So that makes another day of basically just
Soylent (Would one really count 2 breadsticks as a meal? I suppose it's
like toast). Tomorrow I'll try to just do straight soylent, but we'll
see if that works out. I have a friend over tomorrow, so we'll see how
that changes things.

### Day 46

Breakfast and lunch went as planned. Just soylent. My friend did come
over and we made some nacho's as a snack, so I wasn't going to count
that towards my attempt at a full weekend of Soylent, but then _another_
friend came over out of the blue and we ended up celebrating his return
to the state by going out. So there it was. I was one meal away from an
entirely soylent weekend. Not bad. Maybe next weekend I... oh wait, I
have friends coming up I'll have to entertain, maybe the weekend after
that...

### Day 47

So no pizza today since I didn't make it all the way through the
weekend with all soylent meals. Oh well, lunch and dinner were both
soylent with no issue. I also walked around again during my lunch break
at work. Gotta try to get some cardio in now that I'm not really running
anymore.

### Day 48

Walked again today, soylent for lunch while doing so. I ended up going
out to eat though after seeing a special at a restaurant that piqued my
interest.

### Day 49

Pretty much the same as yesterday. Walk & soylent at lunch, then ended
up going out with a friend. And I have plans for a friend visiting this
weekend so that spells doom on that... also, I'm down to one bag of
Soylent somehow! I'll have to order more.

### Day 50

Walk & Lunch as is the routine I'm trying to get into a habit of. Played
trivia with friends so ate out for dinner. Yeesh, so much eating out
this week.

### Day 51

Full day of Soylent! 

### Day 52

Ran out of soylent after having it for breakfast, gotta wait for a
shipment to arrive. But, I went to a cancer charity event and ate good
brisket and food there, so I suppose I'm on a vacation of sorts from
soylent for now.

### Day 53

No soylent, still waiting for the new package to arrive, hopefully it
will come soon.

### Day 54

Still waiting.

### Day 55 

Sigh, still waiting for my soylent. I did get a notification that it had
been shipped though. So hopefully it will come soon. I do miss it,
eating "real foid" is good and all, but, I want my soylent.

### Day 56

All my meals were non-soylent today, but I did finally get my package in
the afternoon. Which is great. I'm pretty happy to get back into Soylent
and having my designated lunch food and such. 

### Day 57

Soylent for lunch! So happy. I really did miss it. Not in an "oh I'm 
addicted way" but in the "man, I could really go for some Soylent right
now" kind of way. To be totally honest, it's a load off my mind trying
to decide where to go for lunch and dinner. So that's nice to have 
relieved. I have plenty of more important things to think about than what
nutrient's I'm going to shove down my throat. 

Dinner was soylent as well

### Day 58

No soylent today because I had made plans to meet up with a friend who's traveling with me. I dunno when I'm going to get a chance to drink the soylent I just packed.

### Day 59

No soylent again, because of travel. 

### Day 60 

No soylent today because of more travel and events. 

### Day 61

Back in town but too much going on to really make any soylent and I had
to throw out the batch I did make a while ago because it went back.

### Day 62

Phew! Back to what I need! Lunch and dinner were both soylent, which I'm
thankful for because I got a lot of exercise today! Walk at lunch being
part of it; but mostly dancing for just under 3 hours with a friend! 

### Day 63

Lunch was soylent today, with the usual walk. But dinner was fast food
for funzies. Tomorrow will be more soylent though, probably for lunch
and dinner because I have outing plans for Freitag

### Day 64

Lunch soylent. Dinner company party.

### Day 65

Lunch was a delicious bit of soylent. Finishing off this batch and 
clearing the way for a fresh batch come tomorrow! I say tomorrow 
because dinner plans have kicked in for this weekend. That and my
lunch tomorrow will also probably be regular food. Lame. 

### Day 66

No soylent today, as expected from yesterday I ended up having 'normal'
food all day.

### Day 67

Made a new batch of soylent this morning. Unfortunately, work things
occured and then I had no soylent at all, then a bday dinner made me not
get my dinner in either as soylent. Which is sad. Tomorrow though.

### Day 68

All day of soylent! Had some for breakfast because I'm going to be on
the go again and need to finish this batch before the day after
tomorrow. Soylent for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. No issues with that,
and after going all weekend with "real" food, it's a good feeling to get
back into my routine and what my body wants. 


### Day 69

Regular day, besides having some soylent in the morning since I need to finish up this batch before I travel again. And by regular I mean, soylent lunch and dinner.

### Day 70

Lunch and dinner again. Had two small, maybe 8oz cups for dinner.

### Day 77

Traveling so no soylent.

### Day 78

Still travelling.

### Day 79

Bet you can't guess what I'm still doing...

### Day 80

Still travelling. 

### Day 81

Travelling, but home tomorrow, so hopefully soylent will resume.

### Day 82

Soylent for lunch today. And dinner. But did get some chicken wings
later on because I felt my body wanted meat. 

### Day 83

Soylent for lunch and dinner today. Nothing else besides a little bit
of candy.

### Day 84

Soylent for lunch, not for dinner though because I had japanese instead. 

### Day 85

Made a new batch of soylent, but didn't have any today.

### Day 86

Soylent! For lunch and dinner. Though I'm supplementing it with some
leftovers from last night.

### Day 87

Lunch and dinner soylent again, you know, besides the slice of pizza I
had last night and along with my dinner today, That's basically two full
days where my meals were soylent. I wonder if this will keep up this
whole week, then I'll basically have done a full week of soylent. We'll
see if I notice anything different from going full-soylent for an
extended period of time.

### Day 88

Lunch was soylent, but since this was the last of the batch and it was
rainy and chill out I went and got some soup for dinner. But tomorrow
will be all about plain soylent all day tomorrow!

### Day 89

Woke up hungry today. I've switched off my breakfast schedule so for the
past two weeks or so I've only really been having lunch and dinner
around 12 and 6 respectfully. So it's interesting to me that I'm hungry
right now, and the only thing I can think of is that instead of having
soylent, which gives me what I need in a cup, I had that soup and
sandwich... So, that's kind of interesting and motivating in it's own
way. Either I should have more than what I had last night for dinner
when I switch back to "normal food" for dinners, or I should just eat my
soylent and not worry about being hungry.

Had soylent for lunch as usual and was pretty content with it. But had a
bit of a day of work and ended up going to grab some comfort food for
dinner. So not a full day of soylent as planned but that's ok. Also, my
new batch of soylent arrived! Woo! Though I still have one pouch left,
so that tells me I need to stop not eating my soylent so often and get
back on that train!

### Day 90

Treated myself to my old breakfast routine to celebrate the weekend.
Lunch was soylent as the usual, but then ended up going out to the
movies and grabbed dinner with friends.

### Day 91 

All soylent day today! Brunch & dinner. 

### Day 92

Soylent for the first half of the day but then grabbed a drink with a
buddy and watched a sports game so had pub food. 

### Day 93

Soylent for lunch, had dinner out again though. Tomorrow will be all
soylent though, plus I have a dentist appointment.

### Day 94

All soylent day today! Yay!

### Day 95

Had food provided for by work, so no soylent lunch today sadly. Then ate
out with a friend as celebration of an early weekend. So no soylent.
I'll have to be sure to smell my batch of soylent to make sure it's good
by the time I get to it. 

### Day 96

Lunch from work again, but dinner is soylent today! Hurrah! Probably the
last of this batch I think.

### Day 97 

Nearly to 100 days! Crazy. Sadly, no soylent eating today because I
just ate chinese food day all day long. oops.

### Day 98 

Soylent for lunch today, but had some take out with a housemate later
on. 

### Day 99

Soylent for lunch, then had fast food for lunch because a long day left
me wanting some comfort food.

### Day 100

Woah. A hundred days already? All day of soylent today! Just thinking
back on when I started this, it's come a ways. v1.5 was ok, but I had to
buy strawberries to make it drinkable for me most of the time. But v1.6
is just perfect the way it is. Although, well, I suppose if it had a
little more salt that might be good. I say that simply because most of
the time when I get a hankering for something after having just soylent
for a while it's for salty things. Or steak. Hm. Steak. 

But yeah, I haven't noticed any ill effects from converting most of my
diet over to soylent. I'm satisfied with my lunch, satisfied wth my
dinners. And on days where I only have soylent, I really don't get a
craving for other food unless I happen to see a really good advertising
or something. If anything, I'd say that the amount of protein I get now
is more than before, and that combining that with increased exercise has
been a big help to me. So that's good. 

### Day 101 

All day of soylent, though I did have some Cheez-its. Going to do some
fun trivia tomorrow, so I don't think I'll be having Soylent for dinner.

### Day 102

Lunch was soylent, and dinner was as expected.

### Day 103

Lunch was soylent, friend came back from overseas though so we grabbed
dinner.

### Day 104

Had a bit of soylent in the morning today, but I think it was
interacting with some medicine I was having and I didn't end up
finishing it. Guess I'll switch over to more solid food for the day.

### Day 105 

Just eating regular food today, tomorrow will be back to Soylent though.

### Day 106

As anticipated, lunch and dinner of soylent today. Thing that I haven't
done in a while though was go for a little over a mile run. That was
before dinner, and when I sat down and had some soylent afterward. Hm!
Hm! It was even better than usual. 

### Day 107

Lunch and dinner for soylent today

well.

### Day 108

some snacks that I bought as well. 

### Day 120 

Had lunch provided for today, and then noticed that my soylent batch had
gone a bit off so I threw it out and didn't end up having it for dinner
since I like to make my batches in the morning so they last longer. 

### Day 121

Ended up not making a batch of soylent because I had an appointment in
the morning and then ate some regular food for lunch and went out for
food with friends for dinner. New batch tomorrow though for sure. 

### Day 122

Made a new batch of soylent and had some for lunch. Was a night out with

### Day 123 

Today was soylent for lunch and for dinner. Some snacks while I watched
a show though after dinner.

### Day 124

A little bit of soylent for breakfast today. But I needed to get a ride
from a friend to go to the store, so I offered him lunch in exchange,
and ended up having normal food for lunch. Soylent was for dinner
though.

### Day 125 

Had soylent for dinner, but had regular food and some snacks during the
day. Was a sit around and do nothing but watch things kind of day.

### Day 126

Didn't have time to make a batch of soylent in the morning so I ended up
just having regular food for lunch then fast food for dinner. 

### Day 127 

Soylent for lunch but then was late getting home and had plans, so I
ended up not eating dinner until late and got dinner with my friend I
was hanging out with. 

### Day 128

Soylent for lunch, and then thought about having it for dinner, but it
was a rough day so I ended up going out. Man, I am doing terrible at
having soylent for dinner this week! And tomorrow is my weekly outing
with friends so that won't be soylent either! Ah!

### Day 129

Went as expected today, soylent for lunch, out with friends for dinner.
We'll try to be better tomorrow and ont go out, yeesh.

### Day 130

There we go! Lunch & Dinner were soylent today. And that finished off
this batch. Gotta make another one. Not sure if I'll do that tomorrow
though or not because it's a holiday weekend and I'm throwing a party
for it.

### Day 131

Party planning and throwing today, so was out pretty much all day so I
didn't make any new soylent and just had normal food.

### Day 132

Spent the day with family for the most part, and then was eating some 
leftovers from the party. So no soylent today. 

### Day 133 

Hadn't made a batch of soylent before going to work, so I just used some
leftover pizza as lunch and dinner. Tomorrow will be soylent though.

tomorrow though.

### Day 137 

Had an extremely lazy day and just ate pizza rolls, so no soylent today.
Wups.

### Day 138

Another lazy day. 

### Day 139 

Soylent for lunch and regular food for dinner.

### Day 140 

Had soylent for lunch and then leftovers for dinner.

### Day 141

Soylent for lunch, leftovers for dinner. I may have bought too much
pizza the other night...

### Day 142 

Last day of soylent for lunch and dinner for pizza. I'm not complaining,
I love both of these things. 

### Day 143 

Haven't made a new batch of soylent yet because the powder is
back-ordered for a long time because of some issues involving people
having a food intolerance to it. So I'm conserving what I have for the
work week since it is the most useful for bringing lunch to work.
Needless to say, no soylent today.

### Day 144 

No soylent today on account of it being the weekend and I'm conserving
until I get my refill order in. I suppose on the bright side I'll get to
try the liquid form of Soylent at a discounted price.

### Day 145

Soylent for lunch and then had some fast food for dinner.

### Day 146 

Soylent for lunch, and then had some leftovers for dinner. 

### Day 147 

Soylent for lunch, but went out for food with a friend for dinner.

### Day 148 

Lunch provided by work today, and then had my usual weekly trivia
session so that was food out at dinner as well. I did get my box of
liquid soylent though, so I should be diving into that and making a note
of the differences tomorrow or the next day.

### Day 149 

Lunch from work again today, but then I did have my first bottle of
liquid soylent for dinner. Man. It's _different_ than 1.6 by a lot. I'm
not sure if I like it as much though. It's very smooth, no grit or
anything like that. It's the consistency of melted ice cream, and tastes
sorta kinda like that too. Though not really, it's really hard to peg
down the taste. I finally figure'd that v1.6 tastes like the milk after
you've eaten a bowl of cheerios with it, and 2.0 (liquid) tastes kinda
similar but at the same time... more like cardboard I guess? Or maybe
the smell is wet cardboard? I'm going to have some more tomorrow and
I'll try to figure out what it tastes like then.

### Day 150 

Liquid Soylent for breakfast/brunch. Went out and saw Arrival last night
so I had some chinese food before hand for dinner. Anyway, back to
breakfast. I'm still mulling over the flavor. It's SO much richer. Like,
I normally drink my soylent pretty slowly, over the coarse of maybe
20-60 minutes most days (I work while I eat). This morning I was
definitely near the top of that range, I didn't keep specific track of
time, but it took me a long time to finish and all I was doing was
reading a book. 

Definitely easier to drink than yesterday, I'm still getting used to the
flavor though. It's more... it's more cardboard-y than the powder
version, but at the same time it's way more creamy and reminds me of
ice-cream / wet paper. I don't know if that duel taste can make much
sense to anyone who hasn't tasted this before though. Like I said
before, powder is like cheerio milk, but liquid is like... well, it's so
exceptionally bland and non-tasting that I'm wondering if my mouth is
just making things up at this point.

### Day 151 

Met a friend for lunch today so I only had soylent for a sort of mid-day
half lunch half dinner thing. Tomorrow I'll probably do a full day of
liquid unless I get irritated and require comfort food.

### Day 152 

Soylent for lunch and fast food for dinner.

### Day 153 

Soylent for lunch and for dinner. Hm hm good

### Day 154

Soylent for lunch, was going to have it for dinner but then I was
supposed to go play trivia with people so I had a quick hot pocket
instead, but then because the trivia place was so full we didn't end up
actually playing and whatnot, so I came home and wasn't hungry enough
for a full meal of soylent, so I just had another hot pocket.

### Day 155

Thanksgiving! No soylent today because I was cooking up a tasty meal
instead. Tomorrow and the next day I might be eating leftovers,
probably.

### Day 156 

No soylent again because leftovers.

### Day 157 

Was hanging out with visiting friends today, and had a thanksgiving meal
with them so no soylent again. Tomorrow my friends are leaving though,
so I'll be back to drinking soylent then and probably be finishing off
what leftovers I have then as well.

### Day 158

Soylent for breakfast, then finish off the leftovers I had.

### Day 159 

Soylent for lunch and dinner, had a bagel at work for breakfast though
so not quite a full day of soylent sadly. Pretty close though. I am
enjoying the convenience of not having to mix and shake my drink I
suppose. But I think I do prefer the taste of v1.6 to v2.0

### Day 160

was a full day of liquid soylent!

food, I still enjoy cooking and make pretty good food when I do too!
Feel like the mellowness of soylent gives me an appreciation for other

Bam Bop for the first time. It was ok, to be honest I think I should
have just gone with my staple of sukiyaki, but trying something new is
good for you.

### Day 270 

Today was another one of those days where I didn't bother to eat until
dinnertime because I wasn't hungry. This seems to happen frequently on
Saturdays. I wonder if I should just start fasting on Saturdays for the
fun of it. I mean, people fast all over the world for tons of reasons,
and it's an interesting experience to feel the slow build of hunger and
the bile from my stomach becoming an obvious flavor to my unfilled
mouth. I did eat though. Had pizza for dinner, and I'll probably go
ahead and have that for leftovers tomorrow for at least one meal.

### Day 271 

Ate leftover Pizza today. 

### Day 272

Didn't have soylent for lunch today because of a going away party, but
for dinner I had soylent and it was tasty.

### Day 273 

Soylent for lunch today, though also had some extra food because work
fed us some steak and other really good stuff. Soylent for dinner as
well.

### Day 274

Soylent for lunch today, augmented with some lobster bisque as well.
Then trivia food for dinner (tasty habanero burger).

### Day 275 

No soylent today, traveling today and for the weekend, so I'll likely
not have any for a while. Instead, I ate a shepherd's pie omelet,
homefries, and toast for breakfast, then had spaghetti bolognaisse for
lunch. Then lastly, I had Wendy's for dinner. 

### Day 276 

No soylent today, I reached my travel destination and so I had breakfast
with my mother of sausage, fried egg, and toast with jam. Then I didn't
bother eating lunch because I was tired and took a nap. For dinner
though, I went out to an Applebee's with friends. 

### Day 277 

No soylent today, I slept over a friend house so I didn't have
breakfast, just some coffee in the morning while chatting with my
friends. Lunch was an asian buffet which was tasty, they even had a
sushi bar which was cool. Dinner was Taco bell with another friend and
it was a good time.

### Day 278

No soylent today, had to travel back home. So no breakfast, but then had
some chili and chicken tacos for lunch. Then I went home and napped
before going over to a friends house for pizza and cake to celebrate my
birthday. Tomorrow I'll probably do a full day of soylent.

### Day 279

Ended up eating leftover birthday cake for dinner, and birthday pizza
for lunch, so no soylent today either.

### Day 280 

Soylent for lunch today, but ended up going out to eat for dinner

### Day 281 

Soylent for lunch today, but it was a trivia day, so pub food for
dinner.

### Day 282 

Soylent for lunch today, but then went out to the movies. I had more
soylent for dinner.

### Day 283 

Only had dinner today, tried a new chicken place that opened up. It was
extremely bland, and had no real flavor. 

### Day 284 

Soylent for lunch today, then had some coupons for burger king so I
checked to see if a friend wanted to go and ended up having some fast
food for dinner.

### Day 285

Soylent for lunch today, then had leftovers from the fast food yesterday
for dinner.

### Day 286

Soylent for lunch, though augmented with a little bit of noodles and
things from work that I ate with my coworkers when they pressured me to
take a break with them. Then it was the monthly trivia night, so I had a
burger and a brownie for dinner.

### Day 287

Soylent for lunch and dinner.

### Day 288 

Soylent for lunch, trivia at night so I had a pub burger for dinner

### Day 299

### Day 301 

Had kiwi and bananas for breakfast, then skipped lunch and had a pizza
dinner out with some friends.

### Day 302 

Soylent for lunch, then had half a bottle of soylent and some pizza
rolls for dinner.

### Day 303 

Soylent for lunch and even got to go for a walk at work which was nice,
then dinner was some fast food because the other week I read about
McDonald's newest shift. You see, they use fresh beef, but then they
would freeze it for shipping; but apparently, as a bit of a test,
they're now not freezing the quarter pounder beef so that it is still
fresh. I went ahead and had one, and the texture is _slightly_ different
and the taste a little bit different from say, their mcDoubles. It was
good. Though not very economical (as all the combo meals are), so I
think I'll continue just ordering from the value menu next time I go.

### Day 303

Soylent for lunch today, also had a lettuce wrap. Then had pizza rolls
for dinner.

### Day 304

Soylent for lunch, wings at trivia for dinner.

### Day 305

first time in ages. Made some Ribeye-Ramen! It was good.

for a cookout where she had smoked a couple pork shoulders. It was good. 

### Day 307 

No soylent today, nachos for lunch again, then had asome asian food for
dinner along with some leftovers from the other day. Tomorrow will be
back to the usual though.

### Day 308

Soylent for lunch today, but I'm a bit under the weather so I had larger 
dinner of leftover rice, nachos, and a lunchable. Gotta keep up my strength!

### Day 309

Soylent for lunch today, also had some chili as well. Gotta have extra
food to get better faster! For dinner I had some spaghetti-O's with
meatballs and then had some pizza rolls. Also drinking lots of juice
with extra vitamin C.

### Day 310 

Soylent for breakfast today, then a breakfast sandwich, then a crepe filled 
with good breakfast food stuffs. Then a plane ride that made my ears hurt like
crazy because I was congested. But then after I landed, on some suggestions from
a twitter user, I got Lou Malnati's and tried some Chicago deep dish. Which was
really tasty.

### Day 311 

No soylent today, breakfast was two bottles of OJ, one of apple juice, a muffin
and a croissant. Then for lunch I had salad, potatoes, carrots, beats, white fish
and pork. Dinner was a bacon burger at a local tavern and two glasses of tasty 
Hefeweizen.

### Day 312 

No soylent today, more convention and travel again. So I had a bagel
with strawberry jam and cream cheese for breakfast. Then for lunch I had
a hot dog, italian beef, salad, and a pickle. Also, I had a piece of
cheesecake for desert after that. Nothing really for dinner though,
until late after I got back from traveling and stopped for some fast
food on the way home.

### Day 313

No soylent today, met up with a friend I hadn't seen in a while for
lunch at a panera, then had pizza for dinner.

though!

### Day 315 

Soylent for lunch today! Rest of my leftover pizza for dinner though.
Also, I realized yesterday was my 314th day, so I should have had some
Pie or something in honor of it. Shoot.

### Day 316 

Soylent for lunch and dinner today. Tasty. Though I did eat some pizza
flavored goldfish snacks and some chocolate after dinner.

### Day 317

No soylent for lunch today because it was a coworkers birthday so we had
pizza. For dinner I had soylent, and then because I was a bit hungry
still I had some dumplings.

### Day 318

Soylent for lunch today, then it was a trivia night so I ate dinner out. 

### Day 319 

Soylent for lunch and then was out to see a friend who I hadn't seen in
a while, so I had some good asian food for dinner.

Soylent for lunch and dinner today!

### Day 324 

Soylent for lunch, then went to Burger King to try their new fruit loops
shake and steakhouse king burger. It was pretty good, the shake was
great, the burger could have used more A1 sauce since it only had it on
one side it seemed.

### Day 325

Half of my usual soylent for lunch (so only 200 calories I guess)
because I was in meetings all day and lost track of time. Then I had a
couple slices of leftover pizza for dinner and then chips and salsa with
friends.

### Day 326 

Had a bagel for breakfast/lunch because I was out and about doing
errands. Then went to a Kentucky Derby party and had some pulled pork,
then finished off the night with a chicken wing dinner. So no soylent
today. Can you believe that in a little under a month or so I will have
been drinking mostly soylent for a whole year?

### Day 327 

Had some hot chocolate for breakfast, but then didn't have anything to
eat until later around 5 when I had some shepherds pie at an Irish pub
before going to see Guardians of the Galaxy 2.

### Day 328 

Soylent for both lunch and dinner. Though I supplemented my lunch with
half a sandwich and some soup in order to make up for only getting half
of it since I was drinking my leftover soylent from Friday.

### Day 329

Soylent for lunch today, then had a southwest chicken sandwich at a pub
for dinner.

town in exchange for a ride to the air port. Then had five guys for
lunch, and then some barbeque ribs for dinner.

No soylent today. Brunch today was neat though, I tried out deep fried
french toast. Which was an experience. Then my friends and I did some
grilling and had burgers and potato salad.

### Day 334 

No soylent today. Breakfast was a really good Vera Cruz omelette though,
and then dinner was some sliders and fries with curry ketchup while
doing some pub trivia. 

### Day 335 

No soylent today. Tried out a noodle shop in town before making my way
to the airport. Then had a dinner of some crab soup and a burger and
fries. The burger and fries sucked though, bland dry and mostly
tasteless. Protip: In Washington Reagon Airport, don't bother with the
American Tap Room and just go around the corner to five guys instead. I
suppose tomorrow I'll be back to having soylent for lunch at least, and
maybe for dinner as well. The slew of days of no soylent were just
because I was traveling really.

### Day 336 

Soylent for lunch and for dinner today.

### Day 337 

Soylent for lunch, but made a pie with a friend and had a slice of that
along with some five guys.

Then traveled for a bit and then had seafood for dinner.

Soylent for lunch and then had five guys for dinner.

### Day 345 

Soylent for lunch today, then had a sip of soylent before going off for
a walk to the bookstore to look for the second book in a trilogy I'm
reading. No dice, but since I was out I went ahead and grabbed some
chinese food on the way back home and had that for dinner. And tomorrow
I have plans with people for dinner, so I've been really bad about not
eating out this week, yeesh. I'll have to make it up to myself over the
weekend by going on an all soylent diet for the weekend.

### Day 346 

Soylent for lunch, then went to a food truck gathering thing with
friends for dinner. 

### Day 347

Had the last of my pizza rolls for lunch, then was planning on having
soylent for dinner but then some of my friends wanted to go get pizza at
this place that has amazing pizza so I couldn't turn it down.`

### Day 348 

No soylent again today, but had leftover pizza from yesterday for lunch
and then went to a cookout put on by the local young adult group. It was
good and tasty and I played volleyballs.

### Day 349

No soylent today because I made a tasty stir fry and ate chips sometime
between lunch and dinner.

### Day 350 

Soylent for lunch today, but then it was rainy and cold so I had some
broccolli cheddar soup for dinner rather than cool soylent.

### Day 351 

Planned to have soylent today, but then turns out work was treating for
lunch so that didn't happen. Had the last leftovers of my stir fry for
dinner today.

### Day 352

Again, work had lunch so I didn't have my soylent. And then my friend
sent me a recipe the other day for Dorito Burgers, so I made those for
dinner tonight (they're really good) so no soylent today either.

### Day 353 

Soylent for lunch today, then had half of a leftover dorito burger and
some pierogis for dinner.

### Day 354 

No soylent today, finished my last dorito burger for lunch and ate some
other leftovers throughout the day.

### Day 355 

No soylent again. It seems recently I haven't been having soylent like
I should on weekends. I wonder if it's because I traveled a good amount
recently and it threw off the habit? Hm. Anyway, today I had some eggs
mixed with tomato, onion, lettuce, and cheese for lunch and then a
microwave burrito for an early dinner. Not the greatest of meals on a
Sunday, but oh well.

### Day 356 

Soylent for lunch today, but then was out buying new running shoes and
grabbed five guys on the way home. Hm hm hm hot sauce burger.

### Day 357 

Soylent for lunch today. Then it was a trivia day, so I had a burger and
fries at the pub.

### Day 358 

Soylent for lunch today, then had panera for dinner since I was out and
about getting a new book.

### Day 359 

Soylent for lunch and dinner today, then had some snacks and gatorade
while I helped tutor a friend.

### Day 360 

Soylent for lunch today, but then had a cheese-stick wrapped in some
really good roast beef, wrapped in a tortilla for dinner. And some
chips. Kind of a funny thing, but the other day I ended up reading the
wikipedia article on fasting. According to St. Augustine's Prayer Book,
fasting means not more than a light breakfast, one full meal and one
half meal. Which is kind of funny if you look through my log and realize
that I don't eat breakfast most of the time. So there's one requirement.
My lunch is a bottle of soylent, which is 400 calories, which I'd call a
light or half meal I suppose. And then I either have another one of
those for dinner, or I have an actual meal. So in a weird way I've been
fasting for 360 days without meaning to.

### Day 361 

No soylent today. I've got this tasty roast beef in my house, and so I
keep making tortilla wraps with it and some cheese sticks I got. Don't
want to let that beef go to waste! Plus, I wanted some meaty food
because I went to the gym today for the first time and met with a
trainer to start looking into a workout plan. And I was sweating after
an hour or so with him, so, I wanted some solid food rather than
soylent.

### Day 362 

No soylent today, had some MnM's though, and some more roast beef wraps.
Which was very tasty. Then for dinner my housemates and I had a movie
night with some chicken parmesian. Which was wicked good.

### Day 363 

Soylent for breakfast today, that's right I actually had breakfast today
because I went to the gym and figure'd I needed some protein after
going. Then Soylent for lunch as well, and then for dinner I had my last
roast beef and cheese tortilla wrap thing. It's surprising it's almost
been a year. Just a couple more days. I'll have to be sure to
commemerate the date by having all soylent that day!

### Day 364 

Soylent for lunch today, then had some leftover chicken parmesian for
dinner. There's still leftovers so I might end up having it tomorrow
too.

### Day 365

One year today! Today was another gym day so I had soylent for
breakfast. Then I took the bus into work so I stopped off at a Starbucks
before hopping on and had a breakfast sandwich and a drink. Then for
lunch I had soylent. For dinner, I had some more leftover noodles with
sauce and cheese. So, not a full day of Soylent like I had planned to
the other day, but getting rid of leftovers is important! 

Anyway, a year ago when I somewhat randomly decided to change my diet
entirely from eating whatever I felt like cooking or eating at a
restaurant I didn't do it to diet, lose weight, or improve my brain. The
things that some people claim Soylent do, such as improve focus and all
that, are not something I really feel I experienced. I think the one
thing that I did notice before was that my sense of taste changed a bit.
I have to imagine though, that if I were to change my entire diet to
bread and water, then eat a piece of candy two weeks later, it too would
be a brilliant flash across my tongue in much the same way that a fatty
crisp piece of bacon is after a few days of only drinking Soylent. 

It's interesting to look back at my first posts and impressions and look
for what's still true and what has changed. My small glass bottle is a
good enough portion size that it fits a single soylent drink in it. And
that is enough food to fill you up for a meal without problem. On the
days where I only drink Soylent I have no problems with hunger, even
though I don't eat breakfast. So I guess, for an office worker who sits
around most of the day, it's enough. With my recent goings to the gym, a
breakfast of Soylent and then the usual amount of things is also enough
to make sure I'm not hungry. I'm no nutritionist, but I have to imagine
that since I'm not falling apart at the seems, being tired, or
particularly irritable, that I must be getting what I need. 

I still haven't tried the v1.8 powder because ever since that issue they
had with 1.7 and the move to the pre-mixed drink I haven't gone back. So
if you're reading this for clues about how the powdered version is right
now, I don't have anything to offer you sorry.

I'm reading through my log and want to reply to some of my thoughts. At
one point (Day 16) I wondered if ones stomach size would be negatively
affected in size by only consuming a liquid drink. In my experience the
answer is no. If anything I'm able to eat _more_ now than I used to. I
didn't start Soylent to lose weight or diet or anything, and I actually
gained weight while drinking it which is interesting to me. Also, when I
travel and switch back to "real" food for 3-4 days at a time I don't
have any discomfort or any problems. So I think that my stomach size and
ability has been unaffected by my diet changing to mostly liquid.

I've definitely been enjoying the benefits of Soylent this whole time.
Not spending time to cook or clean up gives me a lot of time on my hands
to do things with. And when I'm actually doing something productive
(like studying a language) I feel pretty good about it. So if you're
pressed for time and always on the go, I'd think that Soylent would be a
good match for you even if you do it just a few meals a day. I mean,
really, for me it's lunch that has been consistently Soylent most of the
time. And I actually enjoy the taste. The drink tastes like milk that's
been with a bowl of cereal if I had to give the mild taste a
description. And so it's not really gross or anything, and it's not
"future slop" as one might think if you were to compare it to the stuff
in the first matrix movie.

On Day 57 I mentioned missing my Soylent when I didn't have it. And I
still do have that feeling if I miss it for lunch or something. So I
think that my body has gotten used to enjoying the nutrition and protein
and whatnot from the drink. (Not that it complains if I eat normal food
for a few days). But it's definitely like... almost like a comfort food
in a way? Like, drinking it is satisfying. Which is interesting because
it's not a savory or sweet thing that one might normally take pleasure
in. I do enjoy cooking still, but the convenience of having 0 clean up
and - preparation besides putting some bottles in the fridge is really
really great.

On Day 270 was one of the first times I really noted that I barely at
anything at all. And then I brought up fasting, which I noted again a
little while ago after realizing I've basically _been_ fasting off and
on for the entire year without meaning to. I wonder if any of those
alledged health benefits from Soylent are actually from fasting? I have
a vague recollection of reading that some fasting is actually good for
you. Anyway. I'm just rambling all now and I'm not sure what else to
say. Except maybe a final recommendation to people thinking about trying
Soylent out. 

It is

- affordable
- decently tasty
- fills you up for a meal and provides nutrition
- is convenient and good for a meal if you don't have time to prepare

It is not

- Going to replace every single meal all the time for most people
- Disgusting goop that tastes like a sci-fi shows glop looks like
- hard to get a hold of (order it off soylent.me)
- going to replace real food anytime soon.

I know that the guy who made it had aspirations to turn Soylent into
something to give to third world countries that have food shortages; but
the powder isn't going to do that if said country has no clean water.
The liquid drink might though. I don't know what his activist tendencies
are up to or getting at now-a-days. But I hope that people are
benefitting from his attempts to better the world one way or another. I
know that I am. 

Now I have to decide if I'll keep this log going or not.

### Day 366

Work supplied lunch today, o Soylent for dinner only.

### Day 367 

Soylent for lunch today, then had mexican for dinner. Which is the first
time in a little over a week I've been out to eat at a sitdown
restaurant. Oh, and I had Soylent for breakfast since today was a
workout day as well.

### Day 368 

Had burger king for breakfast today because I was out running errands
and there was one nearby. Then had five guys for dinner. Not the
healthiest day in the world by any stretch of the imagination, but I do
quite like hot sauce on my burgers.

### Day 369 

Accidently forgot to eat most of the day. Had Strawberry Sage Kombucha
around 10-ish and drank that until like... 3:30 ish? I was driving
basically the whole day, so I wasn't really hungry or anything until I
got back home around 8. And then I ordered dominoes to get some pasta
because I figure pasta will be a good supply of energy during tomorrows
gym visit.

### Day 370

Soylent for breakfast after my gym visit. Then had soylent for lunch
during my routine walk. Then finished off my day with a tasty tasty
bottle of soylent! A full day of! Well, if you exclude the fact that I
had a brownie my friend gave me as a snack. 

### Day 371 

Soylent for lunch and then had dominoes for dinner since they messed up
my order and gave me credit the other day.

### Day 372 

Soylent for breakfast after my gym visit, and a breakfast sandwich from
starbucks for when I was riding the bus. Then had Soylent for lunch and

Didn't bother with breakfast today, wasn't hungry until a little past
lunch so I got chinese food and had half of it for lunch, and the other
half for dinner.
