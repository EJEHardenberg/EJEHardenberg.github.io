Trying out Soylent
-------------------------------------------------------------

Day 1:

Initial thoughts:

Reading all those blogs and anecdotes about it, specifically [1] 
prepared me pretty well. I was lucky enough to get an emersion blender
for free this week and so my drink is very smooth. I got the powder
version of v1.5. The smell reminds me like flour. And the taste is like
soy, but creamy like milk at the same time. I can feel a little grit
texture wise, but oddly enough it doesn't linger in my mouth with any
bad after taste. It goes down smoothly and my initial thought, like many
others I think, is: "Huh, better than expected".

Day 2:

Only had a little bit this morning because I had to travel out of state
and didn't want to lug a large pitcher with me. But the taste was still
fine, still drinking the batch I made on Day 1.

Day 3:

Had another cup of soylent for dinner, had to work late (on a weekend)
and so I didn't actually have Soylent for lunch like I had originally
planned. But the dinner cup was fine. I experimented with holding
chocolate to my nose before drinking, it was interesting how much that
changed the perception of the taste of soylent. Tomorrow I'll try
putting strawberries into it. I also used my blender rather than an
emersion blender and had better results with removing clumps. The
soylent instructions say that 2 days is typically the max for a batch so
I'll have to make a new one tomorrow.
