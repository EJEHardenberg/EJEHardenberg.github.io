### On Github removing Streaks from their UI

My github streak was over 670 days. My goal was to get to two years, and
it was a really great motivation to look into new software, try things
out, and give back to the open source community where I can. 

Unfortunately, I will never see my streak get to two years, because
[github removed the feature]. This doesn't mean I'm not going to
continue trying to do something everyday, and it doesn't mean I'm not
going to contribute to open source. But I doubt I'll be as motivated as
I was when I saw that number climbing each day. The motivation, that if
I didn't do a little something today, that all my effort, all those 600+
days before, would be thrown away, was astounding in its motivation. 

I traveled outside the country within the course of my streak, I flew to
conferences, and traveled to visit family, and I went to funerals and
weddings. Despite that, every day I commited. Now that the feature is
gone, now what? 

It's not all bad, the new feature talked about in github's blog post
that allows private contributions to appear as anonymized contributions
in the "green square chart" is really nice. I can't count the number of
times after a day at work that I wished all the work I did counted
towards my streak. And I suppose now it does, in a way. But I'm lacking
that number, and that number was _the_ reason for me to try to better
myself code-wise everyday. 

Honestly, I wish they had added the private contributions feature and
kept the streaks number. And I would really like to know what their
justification for removing the feature is.
