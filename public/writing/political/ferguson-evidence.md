### Ferguson and evidence

Disclaimers:

- I don't have a law degree
- I don't live anywhere near Ferguson
- I've watched a lot of livestreams of riots in Ferguson
- I believe that I should read evidence and get multiple sides of a
  story before deciding on my stance. 

Due to that last disclaimer line, it's not too surprising that this is
going to be a long post. Within it I hope to look into the problems
surrounding the situation in Ferguson. What I'm hoping to do, is to look
through the evidence, point out where it does or does not corroborate
the stories told, and to try to take a peak at what the media has shown
versus what I've seen. 

So let's begin. 

#### The Evidence 

For this post I will cite all my transcripts, testimonys, and anything
released about the grandy jury case from [the nytimes information]. The
reason for selecting the times is simply because it has a nice interface
to the data. If you know of corrections to the texts released, or have
belief that they're ill-reported or cited, then please provide your own
sources. 

#### The Medical Examiner 

Starting on [Page 24] of the grand jury transcript we have the testimony
of the medical examiner. With 25 years of experience on the job, I'd say
he offers a valid viewpoint. Some things to note here that stood out to
me: 

- he works 32 hours a week within 2 days. This means that he's
  probably pretty tired by the end of it. His shift starts on saturday for
  16 hours, then another 16 on Sunday. The time of the shooting was around
  noon. Unfortunately within the testimony it doesn't state how long the
  examiner had been awake. (Pg 26-27)
- The examiner gets hearsay information from police on scene, but also
  checks the body to confirm. (Pg 29 - 30)
- The examiner did not take photographs due to the batteries in the
  camera being dead (Pg 32), however, the examiner directed the police
  on taking pictures that he would have otherwise (Pg. 77)
- On Pg 54 The examiner states he did not direct the police, but relied
  on them to take photographs of the body.
- The examiner did not see stippling on the body near any wounds. (Pg. 34) 
- The examiner arrived around 2:30, had to wait for about an hour (Pg
  47), then did his examination. This is normal homocide wait time
  according to him. 
- Examiner notes his head was pointing towards Florissant street. 
- The body had not been moved, this is based on examination of livor
  mortis and officer testimony. (Pg 45-46) Though it is notable that the
  examiner states it is harder to detected livor mortis in dark skinned
  people and so didn't include that in his report. The body not being
  moved is clarified again on Pg 68.
- Examiner counted nine wounds (Page 50), also notes not all of them
  were bullet wounds. 
- The examiner is the one who removes items from the pockets of the
  body, but is not aware if he was the first to do so. (Pg 53-54)
- The body's right arm was out and the left arm against the waistband
  (Pg 55)
- Brown's body had abrasions on the back of his left hand and on the
  right side of his face (Pg 50), it was in the middle of the street on
  the line (Pg 72), and that the abrasions had a bit of gravel in them (Pg
  76). 
- The examiner assumes the abrasions were from the ground and didn't
  appear to be from an altercation Pg 75-76)
- Brown's face was turned facing the left side (right cheek to the
  ground) 

I'd suggest reading all 78 pages yourself, but these are what stood out
to me. Primarily which hands were under the body or away and the
contradiction about directing the police to take pictures. Without
knowledge of the examiners schedule we cannot determine if he was
completely awake during the incidents or during the filing of his
reports. However, since he's been doing this for 25 years, and _only_
works on weekends, it may be safe to say that he was perfectly awake and
aware during the reporting and incidents. Playing devil's advocate, one
must wonder if forgetting about the batteries in the camera could have
been due to a long shift or sleepiness.

#### Wilson's Testimony

- note that the placement of arms/hands is different in tthis than the
  examiners. need to cite pages and etc
