### Ferguson and evidence

Disclaimers:

- I don't have a law degree
- I don't live anywhere near Ferguson
- I've watched a lot of livestreams of riots in Ferguson
- I believe that I should read evidence and get multiple sides of a
  story before deciding on my stance. 

Due to that last disclaimer line, it's not too surprising that this is
going to be a long post. Within it I hope to look into the problems
surrounding the situation in Ferguson. What I'm hoping to do, is to look
through the evidence, point out where it does or does not corroborate
the stories told, and to try to take a peak at what the media has shown
versus what I've seen. 

So let's begin. 

#### The Evidence 

For this post I will cite all my transcripts, testimonys, and anything
released about the grandy jury case from [the nytimes information]. The
reason for selecting the times is simply because it has a nice interface
to the data. If you know of corrections to the texts released, or have
belief that they're ill-reported or cited, then please provide your own
sources. 

#### The Medical Examiner 

Starting on [Page 24] of the grand jury transcript we have the testimony
of the medical examiner. With 25 years of experience on the job, I'd say
he offers a valid viewpoint. Some things to note here that stood out to
me: 

- he works 32 hours a week within 2 days. This means that he's
  probably pretty tired by the end of it. His shift starts on saturday for
  16 hours, then another 16 on Sunday. The time of the shooting was around
  noon. Unfortunately within the testimony it doesn't state how long the
  examiner had been awake. (Pg 26-27)
- The examiner gets hearsay information from police on scene, but also
  checks the body to confirm. (Pg 29 - 30)
- The examiner did not take photographs due to the batteries in the
  camera being dead (Pg 32), however, the examiner directed the police
  on taking pictures that he would have otherwise (Pg. 77)
- On Pg 54 The examiner states he did not direct the police, but relied
  on them to take photographs of the body.
- The examiner did not see stippling on the body near any wounds. (Pg. 34) 
- The examiner arrived around 2:30, had to wait for about an hour (Pg
  47), then did his examination. This is normal homocide wait time
  according to him. 
- Examiner notes his head was pointing towards Florissant street. 
- The body had not been moved, this is based on examination of livor
  mortis and officer testimony. (Pg 45-46) Though it is notable that the
  examiner states it is harder to detected livor mortis in dark skinned
  people and so didn't include that in his report. The body not being
  moved is clarified again on Pg 68.
- Examiner counted nine wounds (Page 50), also notes not all of them
  were bullet wounds. 
- The examiner is the one who removes items from the pockets of the
  body, but is not aware if he was the first to do so. (Pg 53-54) He
  also noted a small amount of weed. 
- The body's right arm was out and the left arm against the waistband
  (Pg 55)
- Brown's body had abrasions on the back of his left hand and on the
  right side of his face (Pg 50), it was in the middle of the street on
  the line (Pg 72), and that the abrasions had a bit of gravel in them (Pg
  76). 
- The examiner assumes the abrasions were from the ground and didn't
  appear to be from an altercation Pg 75-76)
- Brown's face was turned facing the left side (right cheek to the
  ground) 
- The Examiner stated he couldn't tell if the wounds were entrance or
  exit wounds (Pg 74-75)

I'd suggest reading all 78 pages yourself, but these are what stood out
to me. Primarily which hands were under the body or away and the
contradiction about directing the police to take pictures. Without
knowledge of the examiners schedule we cannot determine if he was
completely awake during the incidents or during the filing of his
reports. However, since he's been doing this for 25 years, and _only_
works on weekends, it may be safe to say that he was perfectly awake and
aware during the reporting and incidents. Playing devil's advocate, one
must wonder if forgetting about the batteries in the camera could have
been due to a long shift or sleepiness. 

#### The Autopsy

On Pg 27 of the first grand jury testimonal the examiners report is
marked as State's Exhibit Number 1. Since the identifications are not
listed on the [released forensics], I'll next look at the autopsy report
as a way of checking out the examiners testimony.

The [autospy report] is dated August 10th, a day after the shooting. I'm
going to note here that within the previous testimony it was noted that
it takes around 12 hours for liver mortis to set in. Given this, and
that there's probably plenty of things for an examiner to deal with, I'm
going to assume this was probably part of normal procedure. 

- 7 gunshot wounds that are consistent with the medical examiners
  testimony (head,chest and right extremities) 
- Track in the right upper chest that appears to be a re-entrance bullet
  would continuing from the facial wound. (To me this sounds like a
  gunshot wound during a fall or something similar)
- The wound on the right hand is confirmed by skin tissue on the car and
  is noted as the only close wound. 
- The bullet entered the palm of the right hand and exited near the
  wrist. 
- The police photographs indicate that the gun was within inches of the
  hand when discharged. No other gunshot wounds show this. 
- Three wounds in the right arm. One through the [ulna] bone that
  entered through the back of the forearm and exited through the front.
  An entrance through the front of the upper arm close to the chest and
  exits the back of the arm. And a superficial laceration near the elbow
  that couldn't be determined to enter through the front or back. 
- 2 Chest wounds, one from a re-entrance from a shot through the head,
  and another that entered through the upper chest near the [eight rib].
  It is notable that the bullet continued downard. 
- 2 Head wounds, one bullet that went into the top of the head through
  the brain, and another that went through the forehead, grazed the eye,
  and exited through the lower jaw where it then reentered the chest.
- The toxicology shows evidence of recent marijuana use, giving the
  medical examiners testimony to finding the drug in Brown's pockets
  weight. Though that really has no bearing on the case.
- In order to produce the wounds mentioned, the report states that the
  bullets would have had to travel parallel to the ground and Brown's
  face would have been needing to point to the ground. 
 

It is slightly peculiar to me that the examiner on scene didn't note
the black soot on the skin of the hand area, he noted the gravel in the
abrasions, but the line of the questions didn't neccesary pursue this
either. However the testimony of the examiner does corroborate the
wounds on the right side of the body. 

Based on what the autospy says, we can take a few guesses here:

- Brown was charging the officer as stated in Wilson's testimony
- Brown was falling over and multiple shots close together would have
  had to be shot rapidly. 
- Brown was kneeling or in some position for the officer to be over him
  and able to fire a downward shot. 
- Brown was lying on the ground and so was the officer.

Obviously a few of these are a bit absurd. The last in particular, I'd
hazard to say that the 2nd is as well. Which only leaves the 1st and 3rd
as plausible, at least given that set of the guesses (If you have any
more guesses on the positions feel free to comment).

- note that the placement of arms/hands is different in tthis than the
  examiners. need to cite pages and etc
