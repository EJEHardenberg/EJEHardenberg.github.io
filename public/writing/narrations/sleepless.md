Laying there on the bed, wrapped in sheets shivering as he adjusts to
the cold within his room. The thoughts of turning on the heat briefly
pass through his mind; quickly denied, the urge to stay in bed and not
leave the warm trappings of his own body heat overwhelm any inclination
to change the environment. Wriggling side to side, he begins thinking to
himself. 

What to do today? 

Flights of fancy begin to bubble: an adventure to the lake near his
home? A pleasant meal within his favorite restaurant? Letter writing and
a cafe with hot black tea? Ideas flowing, he almost get's out of bed.
Turning onto his side and closing his eyes he wondered briefly what he
should do before falling asleep again.
