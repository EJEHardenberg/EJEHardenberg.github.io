Laying there on the bed, wrapped in sheets shivering as he adjusts to
the cold within his room. The thoughts of turning on the heat briefly
pass through his mind; quickly denied, the urge to stay in bed and not
leave the warm trappings of his own body heat overwhelm any inclination
to change the environment. Wriggling side to side, he begins thinking to
himself. 

When will I fall asleep?

Turning onto his side and closing both eyes he wondered briefly what
should be done before falling asleep again. After what felt like
forever, but was more likely to be five minutes, his eyes opened again
and he sighed. Fluffing the pillow and rolling to the other side of the
bed. Another few minutes and still nothing had changed.
