The idea bubbles upwards. A small fancy beginning with the age old question:
"I wonder if I can do ...", and his mind is off to the races. Neurons firing
as the idea boils and churns, toying with the concept, he is wondering how he
will accomplish his thought, then suddenly it's as clear as day. -- He'll do it
like that.
