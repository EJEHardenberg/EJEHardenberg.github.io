The rain spattering on the window smears the colors of the city below
into fuzzed circles. The luminescent sunbursts of color filling the
scene with contrasting shadows and light. Occasionally, a vehicle
navigating the streets flies past, shining and destroying the darkness
between the streetlights briefly.  

Blinking, the woman looks down through the glass. Her eyes twinkling
with reflected glow. It is dark in her apartment. Only the lights from
below cast away the shadows in a few places. She sits musing, sipping a
mug of hot chocolate and wondering about life. It's been a long day for
her, work, errands, and struggling to relax. Only now finding the calm
in her life within the warm liquid she's spinning slowly with a spoon. 

Stepping down from the windowsill, she drains the last dregs of her
drink and sets the cup down. Gathering her robe around her and tying it
off as she makes her way to the kitchen. She pulls out a small tin of
leftovers and shovels some onto a plate. Tapping her foot as she waits
for the pulsing din of the microwave to heat her food. 

Making her way back to the window sill, she resumes watching the streets
below. Picking at the now warm food absent mindedly, lost in thought.
