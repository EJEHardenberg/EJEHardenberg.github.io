Standing in front of the crowd, his pink dress shirt triumphantly
addressing every eye in the room, the man began talking. His smile 
chipper and friendly, his hands articulating each point with gestures 
and confidence. The purple flower pin on his lapel did nothing to take 
away the focus on his face. 

His voice easily stretching to the back of the crowd, the words pitched
fervent ideals to each ear. The hopes of progress and the future, the
driving urge to succeed and create. Every indication of the man's
character was that of a leader. The bright eyes scanning and making eye
contact with every empassioned employee. Hoping to pass even a speck of
the zeal which was pent up inside of him. 

The slideshow, buoyed by statistics and charts displaying growth and
impressive marketing force, paid testament to each bullet point. Every buzz
word thrown down gilded with green backed pride. And in the center of
this was this short older gentlemen. Passionately inviting everyone in
the room to join him on the pedastal and drink from their shared
success.
