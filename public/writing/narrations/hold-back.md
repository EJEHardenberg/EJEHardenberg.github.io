The pale glow of the screen illuminates his face. Tired eyes blinking,
adjusting to the sudden light dousing a set of furrowed brows. The words
on the screen, bolded and blue, caught his attention to a name he knew. 

Reading the update his heart sunk. Another disappointment. Another
setback. Wondering to himself why everytime things begin to look up,
they fall back down. 

Flipping onto his back he pulled the covers around him, nestling into
the warmth. Staring at the ceiling, the sound of the alarm jostled his
ears again. Smacking the clock unconscious, he looked at the time and
thought to himself: "half past time-to-get-up o'clock".

Musing over how terrible and utterly unfunny his joke was, he struggled
with his clothes and walked into the bathroom. Peering into the mirror,
he noted the lines under his eyes and the sour taste in his mouth.
Glancing at the time again, he finished his business and grabbed his
work bag off the counter. 

Stretching one last time, he slipped on his shoes, fussed with the sock
getting caught under his heel and then fumbled with the door's lock.
Stepping out into the fog and another dreary day of disappointment.
