Her tiny hand wrapped around the edge of the plastic armrest. Eyes
intently focused and brow raised in excitement. The child was happy,
moving the arm attached to the bench up and down and enthusiastically
saying "here it comes!" to the grey haired woman nodding along.

With encouragement from her mother and the people around her she
continued exploring. Her discovery of the world, and
successive relay of that knowledge to those around her, brought smiles
to their faces. Waving happily to the child across from her she tapped
her feet and the blue lights sparkled from her heels.

The blonde fluff on his hair tossed back and forth as he returned the
wave. With the other hand he clung to his mother's shirt.  Shy and
younger by a year, he preferred watching out the window over touching.
Whenever a truck went by his eyes grew wide. The colors and lights of
the fire trucks enticed his curiosity. On the beckoning of his squeals
his mother raised him to get a better look, and his joyful screams
prompted the girl to look as well.

Together the two families shared this moment. Mother's smiling at their
young and nodding in understanding at one another; children caught in
the joy of something shiny, its noise and discord delivering them from
the mundane life of daycare. The time passed and as the dopplering siren
faded away the young children sat heavily back onto their seats. Staring
out the windows eager for something more than their mother's lap.
