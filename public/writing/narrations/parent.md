The hands he held in his own felt so weak, too weak. With eyes closed
and head bowed he recollected. The embrace he had felt as a child,
strong arms folding over him, and the slight scent of a shirt just a few
days too late to the wash.

Now, only the medicinal and sterile washed his senses. The only arms he
had felt around him, an old lover, had long since moved on to warmer
embraces. The man kneeling and holding the withered bones of his parent
could do nothing but think.

The retreat into his mind was total. Unbroken by any nurse or doctor who
gently touched his shoulder. Their hands, cold, warm, clammy, or moist
went unfelt and completely ignored. The tears must have followed his
mind, as none appeared on his face or made their ways to any duct. And
over time the medical team stepped away to let the grief begin.

It was as if a dam had been erected the moment he felt that weakened
hand clench his tightly, then slip away as the pulse of a machine ceased
its rhythmic beeping. The sight of an arm that once had been twice the
thickness of his own reduced to a quarter of itself shook his vision.
Blackness swept his senses briefly, returning only for a stoic glance at
the face in front of him before it scattered into a thousand stars.

It was a half hour before the doctors realized the man had fainted while
kneeling there at the bedside.
