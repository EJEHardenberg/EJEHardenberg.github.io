He shivered. The canvas rippled loudly as yet another frigid wind ripped
at the tent door. The man buried his hands under his arms, desperate to
find any warmth he could muster. It felt like he was waking up every few
minutes but it was impossible to tell. His watch had broken long ago,
and the total darkness in the small space didn't help.

Buried under a ragged dirt covered sheet and old copies of the paper the
man's shaking rustled the nest constantly. The beard on his face hiding
a furrowed brow and pockmarked skin. Angrily red from the time spent
weathering the storm of life. His lot had made him cunning, and he spent
his time panhandling and finding anything to make nighttime bearable.

His portable shelter elevated him above others who had to risk tickets
and fines by sleeping in more public spaces. With his tent he could slip
out into the woods where the sight of the stars and noises of animals
kept him company. Despite being homeless and cold, the quiet calmed his
worries. Animals avoided his presence mostly, but he still watched them
in the morning if they were near.

Another bluster wrinkled his tent. Its cords straining against the pegs
pushed into the ground. With no idea what time it was, and the cold
refusing to let his exhausted body rest, he waited for the wind to stop.
Curling into the fetal position, the man hugged his knees to his chest
and waited for the light of day.
