A goals nest overhead, the white washed branches arch over each like a
net around posts. Beneath them, the hazy yellow glow of a garage
entrance mixes with the white bulbous lights of street lamps. The
shadows are long, stretched over the sidewalk leading up to the double
glass doors like strands of blackened hemlock.

Laughter and the scuffle of shoes breached the otherwise dull night. Two
boys, teenagers with at least 5 years between them, turn the corner and
into the light. An ice ball heralding their arrival with the sound of
its skidding. The oblong snowball flits back forth between the two, each
taking turns passing it forward and to the side, staying one step ahead
of each other in turn. The ball is up, sliding to oneside then across,
flickering in and out of the light. 

Juking around a pedastrian father, the couple of loud boys laugh and
continue their game into the street. Ignoring them, the man motions to
his hesitant and dawdling daughter. On his beckoning she comes, her head
tilted slightly to watch the game of snow soccer. Arms reaching out for
the safety of his arms, and the height his carrying permits. From afar
she watches the boys banter and run around the contrasted area in front
of the double glass doors. The lights of the lamps above them spinning
the shadows of their game round, fading away as she rounds the corner
and the sight is lost.
