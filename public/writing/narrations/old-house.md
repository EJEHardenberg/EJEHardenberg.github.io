A faded and tattered flag waves in the wind. Its edges trailing their
threads against the knotted columns girdling the open porch of the two
story ranch house. With no ceremony the wind lifts the banner up the
pole, then drops it again.

The home, patriotically sagging under it's own weight, is old. Damp
gnarled wood makes up two of the three remaining steps, and the middle
step lies broken, barely touching the others below and above it. Long
since crumbled, only a few creatures claw their way up the splintered
rot.

Animals entering and going as they pleased, the heavy lock on the door
made no difference to them since half the door swung on the hinges
freely. Torn in half long ago, the barrier to entry hung lower than the
tiling on the roof. Decades of mismanagement had left holes in the
shingles, and puddles of rotted wood in the banisters.

It was an old house, and with its glory days long over, the only thing
left standing was the memory of a time when the banner waving in the
wind had stood for something. Now, like the decay around it, only the
washed out traces of the past remained.
