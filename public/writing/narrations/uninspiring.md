It is Sunday morning. Chopin is playing, tea, clementine, and yoghurt
are sharing the table with the arc of my penâ€”and I am uninspired. It is
not the overcast grey of the sky, nor is it the snow steadily
accumulating dirt from passing cars. No, it is none of thosethings.
Rather, it is my own routine which spirals me and keeps the new muses
from singing to my ear.
