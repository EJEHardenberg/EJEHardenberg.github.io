She smiled and offered her hand. With the music humming to a simple cadence,
the pair began dancing. Each note, each pluck, every drumbeat moving
their bodies in rhythm. This waltz felt like it was meant for them, the

appreciation, the two made comments on the band and exchanged their
thoughts. With the next tune boldly starting, they sat down and talked
to one another's ear, their plans for the night just beginning.
