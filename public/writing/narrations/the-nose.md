one. Onlooking from a few feet away, his friend smiles and answers each
ridiculous question asked. While both have been drinking, one started

Shouting out whether each book is good or not, a small stack of three
books is constructed. Towering perilously near the stackers head.
Rolling onto his side and smiling, he gently pulls off the small brown
hard cover book from the top. A collection of short stories, he exclaims
the author's name happily before flipping the book open to the story:
_The Nose_.
