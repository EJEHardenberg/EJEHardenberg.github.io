Three oak arches towered over the room, their dark wood standing in
contrast to the golden columns inside. Within the taller middle frame
the great rounds reflected the sunlight streaming through the windows. 
Not only white, but blue, red, and purple light shown through the
stained glass windows and splashed across the copper surfaces. Dust in
the air spun away from the openings as the sound billowed from the
pipes. 

Standing in front of the organ was a man in a grey suit. His arms
resting on the pulpit and his voice raised as he led the group of people
in an old hymn. Round spectacles perched on the bridge of his nose slid
down every few stanzas and he adjusted it habitually. Deep and rich,
the simple melody followed the organ and resonated with the
congregations voice. Outside, the choir and pipes could be heard by
pedestrians going about their morning business. A pleasant and simple
Sunday morning for a small town, the bells tolled for another peaceful
day.
