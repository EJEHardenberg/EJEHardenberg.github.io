_Why are they looking at just me?_ 

The thought flew by just as more insults piled on. The words echoing
through the air and around the earings hanging out from underneath the
long dark hair. The faces that didn't turn away in disgust sneered in
hatred; their disdain for this perceived oddity only matched by insults
from the more brash individuals. 

Looking to the right, the friend walking alongside looked over. Their
face was turned down, the loose trousers and dress shirt baggy to hide
their body. Turning, their mouth worked up and down as if to speak, but
no words came out. The only one silent it seemed was the one who might
be able to end it. To stop the jeers and laugther, the uncomfortable
looks and shuffling away. 

But no words came to mind, numbed again, each step was mechanical. The
motions being gone through no longer registering at the two walked down
the hall and past the gawking crowd. Their only crime their faithfulness
to themselves. The loose blouse and simple poodle skirt brushed against
cleanly shaven legs, dusting the knees with each wavering step. One more
time the young boy turned to look at his friend, her face downcast and
gloomy: _Why are they only looking at me?_
