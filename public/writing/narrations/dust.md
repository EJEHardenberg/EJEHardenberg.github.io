Swirls of it in the air, more spilling over the edge of the rough
headstone. Each grave, whether it was standing straight, tilted left,
right, or all the way over lay captive in the summer haze. Where trees
once stood only dried husks remained: their leaves long since blown
away. 

Fires long ago had left blackened sores in the land. Rifts and valleys
of trenches dug in attempts to halt the blazes left the earth scarred in
deep sunken lines. What little grass attempted to grow here that wasn't
choked by weeds was yellow and flaking, straw left where no animal would
ever tread again.  

Within this basin from hell stood a single ounce of civilization.
Pillars marking graves of the dead. Soon, they too would float into the
air, their dust joining with that of the ashes around them. The sky
blackened by wide soot-filled clouds periodically, the winds whipping
them past, desperate to just push it all away.
