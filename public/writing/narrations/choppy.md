Steel blue waves crash against the shore. There is a man standing on the
beach, watching each troff of white foam collapse in on itself. His brow
furrowed, eyes blankly staring off at the hazy mountains. The wind cold 
and cut with flakes of frost, the lake in front of him hissing and
whirling, a maelstrom of discontent echoing his own. 

Putting one step in front of the other he comes close enough that the
water is now lapping at his feet. A slight chill beginning to creep into
the bottoms of his feet. Still, he stares outward, eyebrows tucked
inward: still furrowed and his mouth in a hardline of seething
discontent. 

The water invites him, silently accepting whatever he wants to do. Happy
to help in anyway it can. The frigid embrace tightens as he walks out
further and further. Up to his chest now, his body sways with each
pull and push of the current. Yet still, he is fixated on the horizon,
mouth still drawn tight. 

Pressing down on his shoulders the water slaps him, in response, he
kicks out. No longer standing in the water but floating now. His eyes
closed to the salted bath in front of him. His breath held and face
underwater. His choices no doubt running through his mind as they've
done before. His mind settling on the only one possible.
