The electronic music covers the noise around the room. His eyes are
focused, intent on the screen in front of him. Thinking about how he got
into this situation. Wondering if there will be repercussions for doing
what's believed to be the right thing. 

Attention brought back to the blinking textbox in front of him, he
looked at what the representative had written back. Responding, he
wondered if it would blow back on him to note the security risks. To
detail them and show the exploit. 

For a moment, he wondered if the person on the other side of the screen
was trustworthy. They worked for a large company specializing in payment
software. "Did PCI DSS compliance have regulations for background checks
on employees?" he mused. Regardless, this person could contact a
supervisor for him. 

Hopefully that would be enough, hopefully.
