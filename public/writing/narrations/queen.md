The emanciated man in front of them looked brittle. As if he shouldn't
be capable of standing, like his knees should be wobbling, hands
shaking, and jaw clenched. Yet he did none of these things. 

His jaw, though outlined clearly by the taut flesh of his face, was
strong and set. The eyes, resting in their caverns, looked outward and 
flashed between each onlooking person. His lips lifting slightly into a
smile as he nodded his head to the music swelling around him. Hands
lifting above his head and beginning to pump in time. 

The brittle looking man was gone; in his place was an icon. Smiles
dancing across his feet. The deep purple and blue hued robe sealed away
the slight skeleton underneath. The large billowing sleeves, capturing
each motion the man took. Their folds, echoing every movement in soft
shimmering silk. 

His mouth opened, and from that trumpet came a voice ranging four
octaves. Dashing upward and downward in perfect pitch and time. The
gaunt skin around his face pulled smooth by the intensity of his vocal
performance. For a while longer, the [man] was alive.
