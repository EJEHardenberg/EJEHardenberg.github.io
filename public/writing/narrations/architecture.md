The brutalist archways towering over them, the pair ark their necks
upward. St Michael's sword cleaving the air as his boot stomps a demon
underfoot combined with the gothic spires stabbing the grey sky painted a
portrait of power. Its judgemental stare echoed throughout every block
and brick placed on the holy ground. The clock on the tower's face
reflected this emotion, imposing its continous and steady march towards
judgement and chiming its warning calls each hour. 

To the two below, the immensity of the might of the church was felt.
Each step closer to the building they seemed to shrink smaller and
smaller. The large ordained doors filled their vision and they pulled
strongly on their heavy handles. As the gates swung shut behind them
the air calmed. The rush and noise of the crowd outside silenced by the
thick and solid oak. A foyer filled with glass encased relics greeted
them, along with a double set of iron engraved with words of a tongue
neither spoke. 

The calm of the church removed the smallness of their approach. Inviting
them in and covering each with a warm hush of scented air. The pews
lining the floor each filled with comfortable pillows and tomes of
hymes. Gleamings of a polished organ's brass caught the eye, and once the
turned it followed the length of each pipe to its ending: A
massive and awesome organ, perched over the main hall with regal
looming. Each pipe dutifully shining from the coloured light streaming
from the stained windows onto it. 

Soft murmorings of prayers, footsteps, and the melody of a practice room
puncture the silence of the hall. A few minutes of studying random
artwork along the walls, inspecting the flickering candles on podiums,
and whispering appreciations of each to one another passed. A clean sort
of serenity on each of face as admirations of beauty for the
ancient building spill out. Perhaps lost on them, the religious hymnals 
meant little, but the sentiment and kindness cloaked them despite. After
an exhaustive lap through the building they were pushing through the
iron gates again, shaking their collars and buttoning jackets. The last 
steps bring them back into the noise and bustling flock of humanity 
outside, their backs turned away from the imposing establishment.
