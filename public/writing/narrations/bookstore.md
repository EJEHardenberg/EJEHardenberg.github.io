The gaggle of young students paraded past as he held the door.
Stepping inside, the smell of old paper hit him. Walking over the
hardwood floors, each step creaking slightly, he ran his fingers over
the worn spines. Each book stood on their shelves proudly, waiting to be
opened. 

Without hesitation, he pulled down a catching title, flipped through the
pages and read a paragraph. After a moment, the pages were sealed once
more and standing amongst the rest. Further down the aisle he walked, 
looking for authors like he would an old friend. 

Each story waited to be read and heard. Each new world ready for the 
reading; ready for anyone to dive into. After a few minutes of perusing 
he selected an interesting looking title, read the back, and walked to 
the counter to buy the book.
