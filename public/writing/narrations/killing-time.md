Brick by brick his steps echo across the streets. The pittering of rain
on the umbrella in his hand adding an unfettered rythm to his thoughts.
The air was clean, and even though the wind was a little cool against
his hand, it didn't bother him too much. His mind was lost in trying to
observe the sights he was walking by.

The rooftop's intricately carved sculptures drooled water down from
their archways; puddles collecting quickly into small moats around
doorframes and stoops. Red brick and heavy stones slowly made way for
greenery and vines wrapped around wire fences as he wandered into a
residential area. Happily taking in the full view of each house as much
as he could, wondering what'd it be like to live there. 

The streets were calm, the buildings old, and the babbling of nearby
water broke the silence otherwise present. He walked to the end of the
street, took note of the name, then turned again and oriented himself.
Exploring outward with each lap around the areas he had been. Trying new
paths as he could and seeing where they ended up, he loved the easy
going feeling of aimlessly exploring. 

He smiled and looked upward again, eyeing columns and expertly carved
masonry with a gleeming eye. He was killing time, and loving every
minute of it.
