Sweat dripped down their bodies. The party stood in a circle, each
member laughing, clapping, and smiling as they danced. Hips moving side
to side in time with the beat, each one of them singing along to the 
words blaring from the speakers. 

Tunes that they had heard growing up, tunes they had pulled from bygone
eras, and tunes that were nothing more than rhythm and bass. The club
was dark, but lit by the glow from the bar at the far end and the
flashing coloured lights on the stage. Hot bodies jiving and juking back
and fro in time with the beat, like the pulsating heart of the club they
kept the drinks flowing and the smiles spreading. 

The circle of friends were alone on the small stage at one end of the
room. Despite being on the rise, in front of everyone, they moved and
wiggled with reckless abandon. Not caring who might look up at them and
judge. Not caring if an unhappy wall-hugger turned a sneer towards them.
They were having fun, and nothing tonight would stop that.
