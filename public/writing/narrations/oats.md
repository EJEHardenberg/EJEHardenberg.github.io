The whispy crinkle of bedsheets churning around him eased wakefulness
into reality. Flickering, his eyelids opened to a blurred and hazy
vision. Bright colors, streaks of sun shining across the scene in front
of him. And to his right, a small lump.

Blinking away the morning from his eyes the scene continued to focus and 
sharpen. The chirping of a bird outside and the rustle of leaves left a
calm on his ears. Taking notice of the slight pressure in his hand, he
curled his fingersâ€”and found another set. Awareness streaked through his
body, the lump next to him? A woman. The bed underneath him? Her bed.
The feeling in his hand? Her hand holding his. 

Eyes finally open, his other senses snapped to attention. The crisp,
spiced smell of her hair under his face. The warmth of her body pressed
against his own. Legs curled against his and toes lightly resting
against the tops of his feet. His arm lightly draped across the curve of
her waist. Memories of the night before came strolling through his hand
slowly; the pieces coming together and a smile building on his face.
Letting out a comfortable sigh, he closed his eyes and settled into his
position against her. Completely relaxed, he fell into a comfortable
sleep.
