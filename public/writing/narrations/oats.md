The whispy crinkle of bedsheets churning around him eased wakefulness
into reality. Flickering, his eyelids opened to a blurred and hazy
vision. Bright colors, streaks of sun shining across the scene in front
of him. And to his right, a small lump.

Blinking away the morning due from his eyes the scene continued to
sharpen. The chirping of a bird outside and the rustle of leaves left a
calm on his ears. Taking notice of the slight pressure in his hand, he
curled his fingersâ€”and found another set. Awareness streaked through his
body, the lump next to him? A woman. Rhe bed underneath him? Her bed.
The feeling in his hand? Her hand holding his.
