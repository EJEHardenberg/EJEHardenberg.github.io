He wasn't sure if it was the lights, the birds, or his conscious that
woke him. Uprighting slowly, he rubbed at his eyes. The room slowly
coming into focus, the lights on, the show he had been watching half
finished, and the empty bottles of alcohol scattered around him jumping
into focus. 

A mess of clothes, books half open and partially read magazines 
created an odd mosaic on the floor.
His desk a cluster of papers, empty bottles, and cups provided more
variety to the picture coming into view. Having slept in
the previous days clothes he peeled them off himself before attempting
to stand up. Rushing up to his head, the blood flushed his face and
forced him to sit back down for a moment. Breathing slowly, he tried a
second time, standing up slowly and stepping out of his room.

The orange glow of a dim bathroom bulb greeted him with a hum. Keeping
one eye shut, he opened the mirror cabinet and withdrew his toothbrush.
Letting loose on his teeth and tongue, he scrubbed and scrubbed. The
taste of alcohol and yeast removing itself from his mouth with each
rinse of the mouth. Washing his face, he attempted to remember why he
had started drinking. 

With no clear recollection, he shrugged at himself in the mirror. Asking
himself soundlessly as he looked into his own face, did he need a
reason? It wasn't like he did this often, and he had had fun. Watching
the show while slightly buzzed had made it funnier than usual. With no
alochol left in his house it was doubtful he'd do it again soon. After a
final rinse he left the bathroom, shut off his light and crawled into
bed. The blankets wrapping around him and providing a comforting
pressure, he turned onto his side and fell asleep.
