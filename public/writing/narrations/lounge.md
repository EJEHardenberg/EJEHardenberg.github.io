The deeply coloured wood door, engraved with rectangular patterns, was
easy to miss. Situated halfway through the entryway to the restaurant,
most customers scurried past without even noticing it. Dim lighting and
similarly shaded walls only aided in keeping the door from becoming
better known.

Inside, the concrete walls cooled the summer heat instantly. A quiet
murmur bustled behind another closed door at the bottom of the stairway.
It wasn't loud as you entered, but the sudden noise and dim atmosphere
was jolting from the relative peace of the corridor. Oak panels, hued
golden by the low hanging chandeliers, stood as the backdrop to
paintings and posters. A fireplace crackled at the far end of the room,
surrounded by couches, chairs, and friends sharing a drink. 

This was a space hidden away from the rest of the world. The crowd was
modest during the night, but most of the time there were only a few
sparse groups. Each one keeping to themselves except when writing their
names onto the small chalkboard in the corner to sign up for darts. Low
tension, low noise, and high prices.
