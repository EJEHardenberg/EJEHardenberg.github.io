The crackling fires inside glowed through the pumpkin faces on the
steps. Swirls of white and grey netting meshed overhead in a fake web
complete with oversized rubber spiders and bats. The leaves on the
ground, bundled in composting piles, were a blush of color on the
thinning grass. The Earth's green skin poking through thin layers of
fluff and frost.

Ghoulish sentinels stood guard in the yard along the cobblestone path.
Their leering but empty eyes fixated on each child seeking riches from
the home. Cloth, plastic, and vinyl bags in hand, each sought to be
possessed by candy; their owners working their way from house to house
to fulfill the dream.

Smiles, laughter, and cries of delight from costumes, the packs of scary
scavengers lit up the neighborhood. Older brothers and sisters tugged
siblings along, their mind on returning home. The kids played and ran
with each other through the back streets, parents yelling precautions to
the winds. Deaf ears and sugar induced frenzy setting the night ablaze
with families enjoying their Halloween.
