They waved goodbye, the woman off to her plans, the man back to his half
empty drink. Sipping quietly and lost in thought, he slowly finished his
drink before catching the bartender's eye and asking for a dinner menu. 
The aroma of food that had drifted by him earlier had smelled good. 

Ordering another drink, he settled into his chair and pulled out a book.
Happily reading and finishing another Guinness before the meal came out.
About halfway through the burger the man next to him turned and struck
up a conversation with him. 

A little tipsy, it took him a moment to realize that he was being talked
to. However once the gears turned, he was happily amidst a conversation.
And with an interesting one no less. Among the random families and
obnoxious fratboy's, a man who had decided to venture between all 50
states of the US had picked him to talk to. 

For the next five and a half hours the conversation was lit. Discussing
everything from current issues to life goals and upbringing. The two
chattered away happily. As the men said goodbye and parted ways they
shook hands firmly, whether or not they'd see each other again didn't
matter, the two had both enjoyed their night.
