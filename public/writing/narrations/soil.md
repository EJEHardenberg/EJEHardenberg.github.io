The dark damp earth folded over his hands, granular and moist the tilled
soil greeted his nose with its rich aroma. His knees darkened and
grass-stained, the wader's rubber kept him dry as he rested in his
field. Seasons were changing, and as the sun began to peek it's horned
head from over the mountains so too did his head peer into his family's
rooms. Gathering them early and rising with the day as was his way. 

Cradling the plants from his truck to the ground, pushing and moving
aside dirt to make room for the new occupant. The stems and seeds
nestled into their new home. Each filling the ground not just with their
seed, but with hope. Hope for the new day's light, for the rain's water,
and for the farmer himself and those whom he intended to feed. 

Each day he worked his farm, each day his wife rested her hands on chin
and lightly touched his shoulder, offering his hardened and aching back
and arms respite. The dew in her eyes as she watched and helped the
plants grow filling him with pride. The crops were an extension: of his
dreams for his family to succeed, of his hopes and desires, of himself.
In the same way that the water nurtured his plants, so too did it
relieve him as he worked throughout the summer days.
