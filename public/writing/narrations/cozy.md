It was a warm night, but the friends were spread over the couches in the
living room with fuzzy blankets wrapped around their shoulders. Feet
tucked under the stretched cloth, one of them, a girl with a slight
frame, nestled into the cushions and blew across the steaming mug in her
hands. The wooden scent of fresh tea wafting across the room.

Their home was, simply put, cozy. No elaborate or fanciful decoration.
Just oranges, browns, and yellows made up the common palette of the
sofas, chairs, and rugs. Soft watercolour painted landscapes hung off
the nails that jutted irregularly from the wooden wall panels. Each
framing an experience those on the couch had shared.

In the corner of the room a small stereo hummed and played. Muted
bellows of a French horn and accompaniment filling the small space with
a sweet and crisp melody. The music broken by the regular scraping of a
page as it was turned. With fanciful story in hand, and warmth of heart
and ear, the man reclined and was comforted. A slender hand resting and
combing through his hair absent mindedly in between page turns.

Affections unnoticed, the tea drinking friend continued bobbing in time
with the music with her eyes closed. The swelling of the horn in sync
with her time spent sipping the warm tea. Toes wriggling under blanket
she soaked in the calm. The trio were content with life: their books,
music, and company all contained and reflected in the evening they
shared.
