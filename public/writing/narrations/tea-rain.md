The drum of the morning drizzle against the windowsill mixed with the
white noise of the record. It's slow spinning circumference bobbing up
and down as it's edges were circled by the small black needle of the
player. Light instrumental music graced the ears of a woman reclining on
a couch nearby. 

Her mouth cocked to one side, holding onto a biscuit out of the corner.
Hand curled around a soft covered copy of _Harry Potter_, the other hand
gingerly probing the air above the coffee table. Eyes fastened to the
page, her scouting hand lightly tapped the air in horizontally swaying
motions until making contact with the warm mug. 

Tracing the outline of the cup, she threaded her fingers through the
handle and lifted the vessel carefully to her lips. The steam rolling
away as she finished chewing her cookie and blew over the top of the
tea. It's grassy aroma sweeping over her senses, taking her eyes from
the page she shifted her focus to the light brown mixture in front of
her. The swirling blend was soon on her tongue. It's refreshing taste
sending warmth from her palette to her toes. 

Setting her mug down onto the tab after a few more sips, she closed her
eyes and shifted her shoulders into the cushioning of the couch. Smiling
as the next biscuit from the packaging met her mouth and the text on the
page transported her back into a realm of fantasy.
