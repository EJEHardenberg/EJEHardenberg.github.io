It had been months together on the street corner. The man and woman
dutifully stood, day, night, wind, sleet, or shine at the bus stop.
Throughout the first month they had never spoken, an ambivalent nod once
or twice, but not more than that.

As the sight of one or the other became normal, the two transitioned to
the briefest of conversations. Quick "good morning"s or simpler
"mornin'" punctuated the silent waiting zone. Both of them exchanged
smiles and then did their best to avoid eye contact. It wasn't until the
winter came did they share words at length. Prompted by unusual weather
or odd bits of local news, their friendship slowly but surely grew to
encompass polite political discourse. Over time, the pair, after several
months, learned each other's names.

On this particularly frigid morning the man grasped his coat's lapel
shut and buried his face into it against the wind. Blusters ripped the
water from his eyes in sharp gusts of tears. A small patch of skin,
visible through a tear in his glove, burned bright red amidst the ice
building up around his homespun threads. Spotting the woman he had
become accustomed to standing by in the morning he casually walked up to
her.

"Good morning!"

"Morning!"

"You ever ask someone out cold turkey?"
