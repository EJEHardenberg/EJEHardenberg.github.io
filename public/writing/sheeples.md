Trees streak by their green growing in streaks  
The silver of cars burning under hood hot  
Filing past in rows of dozens where they go I know not   
Sit and look out o'er blue sky   
on which greys slate sits   
undermining the suns eye.   

No Hippocratic seat for yourself as you sit   
A rumbling monster whose clustered innards fits  
Not maximum hold of seventy or more   
but three simple strangers whose tongues are on hold   
One chatters into her phone,   
"dad I'm here" she yells as we roll   
Another lost in a paper, brow furrowed  
Last one sits staring outside,  
wondering whom would listen to what's on their mind  

A Mist and a flicker are both on the eye  
when the ticky tacky houses flash right by   
the little boxes the people live in, in their boxed in life   
no thinking nor worrying, just droning sheeples strifes  
of what to wear, what to eat, what friend to invite  
to your consumptious ball of material delights   
The time spent  there with significant others  
a dallop in the bucket of insignificant troubles
