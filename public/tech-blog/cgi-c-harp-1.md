###CGI with Harp and C - Flat File and Architecture

In a previous blog post I talked about [creating a chat server] and today I'm going
to talk about the overall plan for these tutorials. It's pretty simple, we'll start
by creating a simple flat file database library to store our data. The next tutorial
will focus on using [qdecoder] to create CGI scripts to wrap the code in this tutorial 
and tie it to the web. Finally, we'll create the HTML,Basic CSS, and Javascript to 
tie our new code to our CGI and we'll suddenly have a proof of concept chat server.
