###CGI with Harp and C - Web front end for the Chat Server

If you haven't read the [first post] or the [previous post] you might want to do 
that before starting this one! If you're looking for the source code for the finished
project, you can find that [here on github] in my repositories.

####The Plan

In this post we're going to install [Harp], and I'll show you some quick tricks 
and recipes in making our site look decent. Also, we'll also use [pure] css to
have a decent looking base css file. Once the layout is in place we'll connect
the front end to the backend with some simple javascript using [jquery].
