### How to remove all your google search history

Google recently announced a new feature, the ability to download your
entire search history. This is a giant leap into transparency and
being able to see what the company collects about you personally. At the
same time, it also gives one the ability to remove the information.
While we'll never be sure about what kind of back ups are kept, the
search history being removed, combined with opting out of interest ads,
can help lower your unique online presence. 

Here's how to do it:

First, go to [history.google.com](history.google.com/history) 

Next, select the gear in the right corner

You're done!
