### Thoughts on Github Awesome Autocomplete

It's not every day a [really awesome developer] reaches out and contacts 
you. But that happened today, so I was pretty excited to give feedback about the 
[Github Awesome Autocomplete] extension and figured the best way to do 
so would be to write up a quick post about it.

#### What is it?

GAA is an extension that acts on [github] and [github.algolia.com] that adds a fancy search box onto github.

So the question is how does Algolia's search box compare to github's built in one? Funny enough, a few weeks ago my co-worker asked me if I knew any good open source projects that he could hack on. I searched github and tried to find something for him

I didn't find much when I did my original search, but what about using the 
enhanced search offered by the Algolia plugin?

This is much more interesting, I can instantly a community of users who 
are likely to be contributing to interesting projects, a user's profile 
which might have some good links, and of course the 3 repositories of 
Bitcoin, search engines, and something from Medium.

#### Usefulness? 

I'd score this one pretty high if you like to browse github looking for 
projects to contribute to. Or if you're looking for tutorials this is a 
good way to search for them. Honestly, type in a language, tutorial and 
poof!

The other thing I could see this as being useful for, is if you need to 
search your own repositories often for information. For example, when 
doing the [green up] application, I often consulted my [api documentation]
while developing to conform my work to the spec. While eventually my 
browser just autocompleted, this tool would have saved me the effort of 
clicking through my profile and repositories tab; so I can see it being
a productivity boost to companies that have a lot of internal documentation
in markdown on github or who check on issues often.

#### Overall?

Overall, I really like this extension, enhancing the search on github is 
pretty cool, and the value something like this has to companie's that 
use github for their day to day work is pretty obvious. The ability to 
have the extension search private repositories (after oauth) is also 
handy for anyone hoping to keep their project secret while improving their
productivity. 

I'd recommend you check it out and see if you can find any interesting 
projects on github to contribute to or use in your next project!
