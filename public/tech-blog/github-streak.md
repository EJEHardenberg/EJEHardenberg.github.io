### Commitment and Github, 1 Year of Commits

<img src="/images/tech-blog/github.jpg" />

Today marks an achievement for me. Exactly one year ago I got a crazy
notion in my head. _Why not try to commit something everyday for an
entire year?_. At the time, I had no idea if I could do it or not, and
had only accidently had a github streak for about 2 weeks or so tops.
While I didn't know which projects I'd work on, I figure'd tech changes
so much that it's not hard to find something new to blog about, or to
experiment with. 

Since that day one year ago I've made quite a few contributions to the
tech community. For example, way back in February I contributed to
[notwaldorf's shrinkwrap project] the ability to edit T-Shirt Sizing
cards. For a short time I was actively writing blog posts about [macros
in HarpJS] and enhancements like [RSS with Harp]. Outside of writing
about Harp, I was creating [chrome extensions] and [twitter apps] for
use by internet activists.

While I was mostly content to stay in my own corner of the internet this
year, I did reach out to [a couple] other [open] source projects, and one
even [reached out to me]. Which was a fantastic way to start a day. But
really, contributing to the tech community at large is a great feeling,
and I sometimes wonder if people don't always do it because they think a
contribution has to be large. That's not always the case. A simple
[performance test] can provide good metrics for scaling that other
developers can use to test their own improvements. No matter how small,
even if it's just [documentation] it can be helpful. 

That's not to say I was coding everyday. If I were to look through all
my commits I'd probably find that most of them weren't actually code.
(this is mainly because my code commits are in private repositories for
work and such)
My github streak primarily consists of writing. From [technical
blog posts] on everything from [python string performance], [how to use
strace to debug], or even [touching on education], I wrote a lot this
year. Sometimes about the newest [cheap recipe I've come up with].
Sometimes just looking at some [weird laws], it's fun to write about the world
around me. 

And that's primarily what I do with the [biggest contributions] to my
github streak. I've written ~73 [narrations], ~105 [poems], and ~84
[tech posts] this year. Writing has become an enjoyable hobby for me, whether it's
just venting out about [hypocrites], or reminding myself that people are
people and we're just one [humanity], poetry and prose is really fun.
Writing short stories and small segments about [people's lives I see]
or just running with [whatever inspires me] is a great way to start my
mornings. Because I take the bus to work, I almost always have some
[small piece of human interaction] that can spark a story, there's so many
[people out there], and so many [emotions people can feel], it's nearly
endless what you can write about. And I don't really plan on stopping
anytime soon. 

Currently, I'm working in [scala a lot], and redoing my [expense
tracking software]. I always try to have at least one side project going
on at a time that's related to code, and this year I'm going to add a
writing project on the side as well. While I won't link it yet, I've
decided to put my [smut writing] to good use and write a book. While I
don't know how long it will take me, or even what I'll do with it when
I'm done, I figure it will be fun to take a step back from writing
shorter pieces, and focus on a longer and more complex work. I'm not
sure if I'll be as obsessed with keeping my streak going or not (did I
mention I traveled outside the country this year and brought my laptop
along explicitly to write and keep my streak going? Or that I coded an
entire javascript experiment [at the airport on a
smartphone]?\*). But no matter what, I'll try to contribute
to open source libraries I use, and I'd encourage everyone else to do so
as well.
