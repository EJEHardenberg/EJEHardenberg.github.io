    <h2>This post is by no means a tutorial, just chronocling my short adventure into HTML templates tonight. </h2>
<p>I&#39;ve just started playing around with HTML templates. It took me a small
amount of searching for the right tutorials, but after a while I found 
a couple that when I combined them it all started worked together nicely. `</p>
<p><a href="handlebarsjs.com">HandleBars</a> is pretty simple to use. Stare at the 
documentation and syntax for a while, then realize that yes, if you want
to do anything &#39;fancy&#39; like <code>if(a==b)</code> that you&#39;ll need to write your own
helper. But, if you&#39;re just looking for some simple and easy to use
templating, it&#39;s great. </p>
<p>I knew from the start, that I wanted to include my templates from seperate
files. It didn&#39;t make much sense to me to put the template directly into
my source code files, since the only things I wanted to template for were
items that would appear across multiple pages and it makes sense then to
push the templates into their own files for that. So I decided to include
jQuery into my project so I wouldn&#39;t spend a lot of time writing javascript
ajax boilerplate code.  </p>
<p>The <code>.load()</code> function turned out to be very useful. Since I could point it
to a url and then simply use a callback function once it was done. After
a few false starts (such as realizing that <code>if(a==b)</code> was beyond Handlebar&#39;s
abilities) I got a template spitting information out onto the page. </p>
<p>From there, I moved the data itself into it&#39;s own file that I loaded again, 
with <code>.load()</code>. Figuring that if I make a backend API to power my small
project I&#39;m starting on, that abstracting the data into it&#39;s own areas 
accesible via URL now, will turn out to be good foresight later on. </p>
<p>We&#39;ll see what else comes of it. Oh, the best thing about HandleBar is 
that you can <em>precompile</em> your templates, which means that when you&#39;re
creating dozens of templated items, that you can save yourself a good 
amount of processing time just by compiling early and not for each
instance of your templated data.</p>
