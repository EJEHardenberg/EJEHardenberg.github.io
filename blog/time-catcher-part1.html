    <p>I&#39;ve begun work on a <a href="https://github.com/EJEHardenberg/timecatcher">new project</a> and so far it&#39;s coming along nicely. I&#39;ve been using some software at work to keep track of my hours, it&#39;s called office time. It works fine, simple interface, easy to manage for the most part, and at least 20 features I don&#39;t use. Ever. </p>
<p>So being the kind of guy I am, I decided that I could probably make a simple to use task tracking utility. Here are some of my motivations. </p>
<ul>
<li>I spend about 60-80% of my day in a terminal. So I should be able to access the utility from there</li>
<li>I need to keep track of a task per day, and then be able to display it meaningfully later on</li>
<li>I want to be able to add notes to myself about the task as I work on it</li>
<li>I should only be active on a single task at a time</li>
</ul>
<p>So let&#39;s see. I&#39;m going to working in the command line, well that means I&#39;ll want an executable file. I could write a bash script, but bash syntax is not the best for anything complicated. So I want a higher language. I want to sit low, and I like C. So I&#39;ll do it in C. </p>
<p>Keeping track of a single task, well that&#39;s simple. Give it a name. I&#39;ll have to be able to have it be permanent, and I even have a process running in the background (no) or I make an object of some kind in a file and use that to keep track of things. Now that sounds easy. If it works for git, it will work for me. If I want to keep track of my tasks per day, I should store these object files into their own folder, named after the current date. The benefit to this is that if I want to generate spreadsheets or information later on, I can do it by date with these folders.</p>
<p>Adding a note, well that&#39;s easy too, keep track of it in the file for the current task.</p>
<p>Being active on only a single task at a time? Now that seems hard to enforce. Because I&#39;ll be able to start a task, then end a task with a command. So I could fire off a bunch of tasks then finish them when I wanted to and the timing data would be complete garbage. Ah! So I&#39;ll keep track of the last created task in some type of master file. Easy! When a new task is created, the other task will be &#39;paused&#39; or for starters I won&#39;t let a user switch tasks unless they finish one first. </p>
<p>And this is my first plan. So far it&#39;s coming along and I&#39;ve got the directory to hold this information all good and am writing out the usage documentation, as a guide to me and a guide to anyone else who wants to use it. </p>
