###Harp and Smut

I like to write. When I'm bored in the morning sometimes I get inspired by some
nice scenary, or something a friend says to me. It sparks off a phrase that
mutates into sentences or paragraphs. Sometimes it ends up as [poetry]; Other
times it appears as [narrations]; and other times it's just pure [smut]. 

I decided to use [harp] to create the site. Seeing as I'd been [featured] in 
their blog for a script I wrote to migrate Wordpress sites to Harp sites a little
easier, it just seemed like I should do _some_ project in it. 

So, after some head scratching at EJS's documentation, and some furious collecting
of various writings of mine from different blogging sources. It only took about 2
hours to create the [little site here] which is pretty good. Harp is simple and
easy to use and I recommend it to anyone getting into static site generators, to 
me at least, it was WAY more intuitively than Jekyll (which this site runs on)
