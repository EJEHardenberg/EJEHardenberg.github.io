    <h3>Harp and Smut</h3>
<p>I like to write. When I&#39;m bored in the morning sometimes I get inspired by some
nice scenary, or something a friend says to me. It sparks off a phrase that
mutates into sentences or paragraphs. Sometimes it ends up as <a href="ejehardenberg.github.io/writing/poetry">poetry</a>; Other
times it appears as <a href="ejehardenberg.github.io/writing/narrations">narrations</a>; and other times it&#39;s just pure <a href="ejehardenberg.github.io/writing/smut">smut</a>. </p>
<p>I decided to use <a href="harpjs.com">harp</a> to create the site. Seeing as I&#39;d been <a href="http://harpjs.com/blog/harp-weekly-2013-11-17">featured</a> in 
their blog for a script I wrote to migrate Wordpress sites to Harp sites a little
easier, it just seemed like I should do <em>some</em> project in it. </p>
<p>So, after some head scratching at EJS&#39;s documentation, and some furious collecting
of various writings of mine from different blogging sources. It only took about 2
hours to create the <a href="ejehardenberg.github.io/writing">little site here</a> which is pretty good. Harp is simple and
easy to use and I recommend it to anyone getting into static site generators, to 
me at least, it was WAY more intuitively than Jekyll (which this site runs on)</p>
