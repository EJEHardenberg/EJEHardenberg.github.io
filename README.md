This is my website, there are many like it, but this one is mine. And
you can [view it here]

Setup:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Install Harp
 - Run harp server
 - Browse to localhost:9000

Or you could just [visit the site] to see the content. 

This site uses [Harp] and is a decent example (I think) of a couple of
good macros you can use in your own. For example:

- [CDN Recipe]: use a static host and this macro to get cookieless
  images and resources onto your website, from different hosts or
  multiple, it's possible.

- [XML Sitemap]: an adaption of Harp's sitemap recipe (ordered list)
  into a search engine compliant xml format.

- [Javascript Inclusion]: a recipe on including javascript files based on your
  file path.

- [Autoload Resources]: a recipe on including both CSS and Javascript based on
  the current file path.

I also blog about my projects that I do, you can checkout the project page on 
the website for that. One of the ones that I like is my [chat server tutorial] 
series. I've also recently got into [Play!], Feel free to check it out!

I even started up a [opinion] section so I could blog about the various things that 
go on in the world around us today. I'm no journalist, but everyone's voice matters.
