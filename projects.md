Projects
-----------------------------------------------------------------------


In my spare time I like to work on my own projects or collaborate with others on solutions to problems in the community. My most recent work is listed below, for a full list you can [click here]. I try my best to keep this up to date, but if you're really aching to know what I've been up to, checkout my [Github] for the most up to date information.

- TimeCatcher - Fall 2013
	- TimeCatcher is a time logging utility which doesn't eat your CPU cycles. Most logging software runs in the background spinning the clock away to keep track of your progress. TimeCatcher works on a simple start and stop system managed through the command line in order to not do that. Memory leak free and supporting command completion through bash shells, time catcher is a simple to use and good time logging program.
	- You can checkout the [TimeCatcher Repository here]

- Xemark - Summer 2013
	- Xemark is a simple markdown language designed to be translated into html by a parser following it's BNF grammar. The parser was used as a component in generating this webpage. A bash script made did the rest of the work. Xemark functions like a CGI script in that it's input is translated from one format to an output in another (in this case xemark markdown to html). Becuase of this property it is easy to use xemark within a http server context to serve .xe files up as html to users.

- Green Up VT - Summer 2013
	- An application to assist with [GreenUp Vermont] and help to coordinate volunteers. Developed as part of the national [Civic day of hacking] challenge by [Code for BTV]. The application was hastily made in php during the event. Then heaviy refactored into a RESTful API with mobile,ios and android client interfaces (Still in progress). My main contribution was the specification, design, and implementation of the REST api backend done in python. Also primarily responsible for task delegation and repository contribution maintenance.

- Linkregater - Summer 2013
	- A web crawling visualization written in Javascript and making use of HTML5's canvas for drawing. Simply enter a url and watch it do it's work! It does perform a large number of HTTP requests and might slow down your browser while it runs. Simply close the tab if it becomes a problem. 
	- Check out [the Linkregater App here]
	
- Rat-a-tat-cat - Spring 2013
	- A google app engine card game created for my Software Engineering class. Implementation was done in an agile workflow with a group headed by [Phelan Vendeville]. Responsible for architecture design, repository maintenance, and artificial intelligence for computer player.

- Presentation on Multiple Level Association Analysis -Spring 2013
	- A presentation on Mining Multiple-Level Association Rules in Large Databases adapted from Jiawei Han, and Yongjian Fu's original presentation for my CS 332 Data Mining class.
