Besides Programming, I enjoy writing human-readable text as well. I've used 
blogger in the past to run both Personal and Technical blogs, but recently I've
been using this github pages as a blogging platform for technical work. It's
become easy enough that I hardly use the [old blog] and so I've decided to begin
to focus my new writings just here. 


<div class="big-button">
	<a href="/blog">
		To view my Technical Blog
	</a>
</div>

<div class="big-button">
	<a href="/writer" title="Read at your own risk!">
		To view my non-technical work
	</a>
</div>
